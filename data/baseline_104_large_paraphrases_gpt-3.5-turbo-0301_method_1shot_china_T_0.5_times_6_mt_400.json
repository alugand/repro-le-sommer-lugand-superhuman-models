Additionally, the detection of smaller NEOs can be challenging, and some may not be detected until they are very close to Earth.\n\nGiven the success of NASA's NEO detection program, and the fact that the program is continually improving its detection capabilities, I estimate that the probability of an asteroid or comet of at least 50 meters in diameter being detected on a collision course with Earth before 1 January 2100, with the detection made before 1 January 2025, is very high.\n\nTherefore, the probability of such an event occurring is around 95%.\n\n[Answer] 0.95",
                "On the YES side, there are several ongoing efforts to detect and track near-Earth objects (NEOs), including asteroids and comets, that could pose a threat to Earth.\nNASA's Near-Earth Object Observations Program, for instance, is dedicated to detecting and tracking NEOs larger than 140 meters in diameter.\nMoreover, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), which is expected to become operational in 2022, will be capable of detecting NEOs as small as 30 meters in diameter.\nGiven these efforts, it is likely that at least one asteroid or comet of at least 50 meters in diameter on a collision course with Earth would be detected before 1 January 2025.\n\nOn the NO side, it is possible that an asteroid or comet of at least 50 meters in diameter could be on a trajectory that would lead to a collision with Earth, but would not be detected before 1 January 2025.\nMoreover, the probability of such an event occurring is relatively low, given the vastness of space and the rarity of such collisions.\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of an asteroid or comet of at least 50 meters in diameter being detected on a trajectory that would lead to a collision with Earth, with the collision due to occur before 1 January 2100, and the detection made before 1 January 2025 is around 80%.\n\n[Answer] 0.8",
                "According to NASA's Near-Earth Object (NEO) detection program, there are no known asteroids or comets that are currently on a trajectory to collide with Earth before 2100.

Additionally, NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO) is actively working on improving our ability to detect and mitigate potential asteroid impacts.\n\nOn the NO side, detecting a relatively small asteroid or comet on a collision course with Earth is a challenging task, and it is possible that such an object could go undetected until it is too late.\n\nGiven the ongoing efforts to improve our detection capabilities and the low probability of a collision occurring, I estimate that the probability of an asteroid or comet estimated to be at least 50 meters in diameter being detected on a trajectory that would lead to a collision with Earth, with the collision due to occur before 1 January 2100, and the detection made before 1 January 2025 is around 20%.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",

Additionally, macro-sociology models may not be as data-intensive as some other fields, which could further limit the use of this criterion.\n\nOn the NO side, the use of losslessly compressed data as a model selection criterion has already been proposed in several social science papers, and it is gaining attention as a potential alternative to traditional model selection methods.

However, based on the current trends in social science research and the use of lossless compression in data analysis, it is unlikely that this specific criterion will become a widely accepted model selection criterion among macro-sociology models in the near future.\n\nOn the YES side, there is a growing trend towards using more sophisticated statistical models in social science research, and the use of lossless compression as a model selection criterion may become more popular as a result.\n\nOn the NO side, there are several reasons why this criterion may not become widely accepted. Firstly, the use of lossless compression as a model selection criterion is still a relatively new and untested approach. Secondly, there may be other more established and widely accepted model selection criteria that are preferred by researchers in the social sciences.

It is more common to use criteria such as goodness-of-fit, predictive accuracy, and parsimony. Additionally, macrosociology models tend to focus on large-scale social phenomena, and the use of losslessly compressed data may not be appropriate or relevant in this context. \n\nOn the NO side, it is difficult to predict future trends in research practices.

Additionally, the Melbourne Cup is a highly prestigious and traditional event, and there may be resistance to changing the rules around the use of whips.\n\nHowever, given the increasing public concern about animal welfare issues, and the fact that other countries have already banned the use of whips in horse racing, I estimate that the probability of the use of whips being banned on or before the 2026 Melbourne Cup thoroughbred horse race is around 0.7.\n\n[Answer] 0.7",
                "On the YES side, there is increasing public scrutiny and criticism of the use of whips in horse racing, which has led to some changes in regulations in various countries.\nIn Australia, the use of whips is already restricted, and some racing organizations have called for a complete ban.\nMoreover, the Melbourne Cup is one of the most prestigious horse races in the world, and a ban on whips would send a strong message to the industry and the public.\nHowever, there is currently no official timeline or plan for a ban on whips in the Melbourne Cup.\n\nOn the NO side, the horse racing industry is deeply ingrained in Australian culture and economy, and any significant changes are likely to face resistance from stakeholders.\nMoreover, the use of whips is seen by some as necessary for safety and effective communication with the horse.\n\nConsidering the above factors, I estimate that the probability of a ban on whips in the Melbourne Cup on or before 2026 is relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",

In 2020, Saudi Arabia allowed Israeli flights to use its airspace, and there have been reports of secret meetings between Saudi and Israeli officials. Additionally, both countries share concerns about Iran's regional ambitions and could see normalization as a way to counterbalance Iran's influence. \n\nOn the NO side, the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Israel is still very delicate, and there is strong opposition to normalization from some segments of Saudi society. Additionally, Saudi Arabia has historically been a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause, and normalization could be seen as a betrayal of that cause. Finally, the timeline of 2031 is relatively short, and it may take longer for the two countries to fully normalize relations.\n\nTaking all of these factors into account, I estimate that the probability of Saudi Arabia normalizing relations with Israel by 2031 if Iran does not get a nuclear bomb by then is around 40%.\n\n[Answer] 0.4",

However, Saudi Arabia has maintained that any normalization of relations with Israel would be contingent on a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nOn the YES side, if Iran does not acquire a nuclear bomb by 2031, it is possible that Saudi Arabia may feel less threatened by Iran and more open to normalizing relations with Israel. Additionally, Saudi Arabia may see benefits in aligning with Israel against common regional threats.\n\nOn the NO side, Saudi Arabia has historically been a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause and may not want to normalize relations with Israel without a resolution to the conflict.

Saudi Arabia has also allowed Israeli planes to use its airspace in recent years, which is a significant development.\nFurthermore, if Iran does not get a nuclear bomb by 2031, it might reduce the perceived threat to Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries, which could make them more willing to normalize relations with Israel.\n\nOn the NO side, there are many factors that could prevent Saudi Arabia from normalizing relations with Israel, even if Iran does not get a nuclear bomb by 2031. These include domestic opposition, regional dynamics, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which remains a sensitive issue for many Arabs and Muslims.\nMoreover, the current Saudi leadership has been focused on domestic reforms and economic diversification, which might limit its ability or willingness to engage in controversial foreign policy initiatives.\n\nGiven these factors, I estimate that the probability of Saudi Arabia normalizing relations with Israel by 2031 if Iran does not get a nuclear bomb by then is around 30%.\n\n[Answer] 0.3",

However, I will try to provide an estimate based on available information.\n\nOn the YES side, Pakistan is one of the nine countries known to possess nuclear weapons, and there are concerns about the security and safety of its nuclear arsenal.\nPakistan has a history of political instability, and there is a risk of a terrorist group gaining access to its nuclear weapons or materials.\nIf an offensive nuclear detonation were to occur in Pakistan, there is a significant risk of fatalities, either from the blast or from the resulting radiation.\n\nOn the NO side, the likelihood of an offensive nuclear detonation in Pakistan is relatively low, as it would be a catastrophic event with severe consequences for the country and the region.\nMoreover, Pakistan has taken measures to improve the security of its nuclear weapons, and there have been no reported incidents of nuclear terrorism involving Pakistan to date.\n\nTaking into account these factors, I estimate that the probability of at least one fatality from an offensive nuclear detonation in Pakistan by 2030, if there's an offensive detonation anywhere by then, is relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",

                "This is a very difficult question to answer with any degree of confidence, as it involves predicting both the occurrence of an offensive nuclear detonation and the likelihood of a fatality resulting from such an event.\n\nOn the YES side, Pakistan is a nuclear-armed state with a history of conflict with its neighbor India. The risk of an accidental or intentional nuclear detonation cannot be ruled out entirely, and if such an event were to occur, there would likely be significant loss of life.\n\nOn the NO side, the probability of an offensive nuclear detonation anywhere in the world is already very low, and the likelihood of such an event occurring in Pakistan specifically is even lower. Additionally, the security measures around Pakistan's nuclear arsenal are believed to be robust, which could reduce the risk of an accidental or unauthorized detonation.\n\nTaking into account both views, I estimate that the probability of there being at least one fatality from an offensive nuclear detonation in Pakistan by 2030, if there's an offensive detonation anywhere by then, is very low.\n\n[Answer] 0.1",

                "Predicting specific events such as an offensive nuclear detonation and its consequences is extremely difficult. However, I can provide some insights on the probability of such an event occurring.\n\nOn the YES side, Pakistan has a history of instability and tensions with neighboring countries, particularly India. There have been several instances of border conflicts and terrorist attacks in the past. Additionally, Pakistan has a nuclear arsenal that it sees as a deterrent against India, and it has a doctrine of using nuclear weapons in response to a conventional attack. If an offensive nuclear detonation were to occur, the risk of fatalities would be high.\n\nOn the NO side, the use of nuclear weapons is widely regarded as a last resort due to the catastrophic consequences. Pakistan is also a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which commits it to not using nuclear weapons except in self-defense. Furthermore, the international community has been working to prevent the use of nuclear weapons through arms control agreements and diplomatic efforts.\n\nTaking into account the above factors, I estimate that the probability of at least one fatality from an offensive nuclear detonation in Pakistan by 2030, if there's an offensive detonation anywhere by then, is very low.\n\n[Answer] 0.1",

Moreover, Pakistan has a policy of keeping its nuclear weapons ready for use, which increases the risk of an accidental or intentional detonation. If a nuclear detonation were to occur, the chances of a fatality would be high due to the destructive power of nuclear weapons.\n\nOn the NO side, the use of nuclear weapons is heavily discouraged by the international community, and Pakistan is a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Additionally, the consequences of a nuclear detonation would be severe, including international condemnation and potential military retaliation.\n\nConsidering the low probability of an offensive nuclear detonation in Pakistan and the even lower probability of a fatality resulting from such an event, I estimate the probability of at least one fatality from an offensive nuclear detonation in Pakistan by 2030, if there's an offensive detonation anywhere by then, to be very low.\n\n[Answer] 0.1",

There is a possibility of an armed conflict between the two countries that could escalate to a nuclear exchange. Additionally, Pakistan has been facing internal instability and terrorism, which raises the risk of nuclear weapons falling into the wrong hands.\n\nOn the NO side, the use of nuclear weapons is widely considered a last resort due to the catastrophic consequences that would result. The international community has been working to prevent the use of nuclear weapons and to promote disarmament. Additionally, Pakistan has shown restraint in its nuclear posture and has made efforts to improve its nuclear security.\n\nGiven the catastrophic consequences of a nuclear detonation, I estimate that the probability of such an event happening is very low. However, it is impossible to estimate the probability of a fatality resulting from such an event. Therefore, I estimate the probability of at least one fatality resulting from an offensive nuclear detonation in Pakistan by 2030, if there's an offensive detonation anywhere by then, to be extremely low.\n\n[Answer] Very low."

Additionally, demographic changes, such as a decreasing birth rate, could lead to a smaller pool of college-aged students.\n\nHowever, a 50% decline in college attendance seems highly unlikely given the stability of college attendance rates in the past. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of the percentage of college-aged U.S. citizens who are attending postsecondary educational institutions in the United States dropping at least 50% from the level in 2011 by 2040 is very low.\n\n[Answer] 0.1"

Therefore, it is possible that the EU will extend these regulations to include fish as well.\n\nOn the NO side, the commercial fishing industry may resist such regulations, arguing that stunning fish before slaughter is not practical or economically viable. Additionally, there may be concerns about the impact of stunning on the quality of fish meat.\n\nOverall, I estimate that the probability of the EU enacting legislation or a directive that requires commercially farmed fish to be stunned before being slaughtered by the end of 2029 is around 60%.\n\n[Answer] 0.6",

There has been a gradual increase in the number of vegetarians in the U.S. over the past few decades, but the rate of increase has been relatively slow.\n\nOn the YES side, there is a growing trend towards plant-based diets and a reduction in meat consumption due to concerns about health, animal welfare, and the environment. This trend is reflected in the increasing availability of vegetarian options at restaurants and grocery stores, as well as the rise of plant-based meat alternatives. Additionally, younger generations are more likely to adopt plant-based diets, which could drive up the overall percentage of vegetarians in the future.\n\nOn the NO side, there are still significant cultural and economic factors that promote meat consumption in the U.S., such as the popularity of fast food and the influence of the meat industry. Additionally, the trend towards plant-based diets may slow down or plateau in the future.\n\nGiven these factors, I estimate that the probability of \u22658% of adults in the U.S. self-reporting as vegetarians before Jan 1st, 2036, in a major poll of a representative cross section of U.S. adults is relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",

However, this rate of increase is not significant enough to reach 8% by 2036.\n\nOn the other hand, there is a growing trend towards plant-based diets and an increasing awareness of the environmental impact of meat consumption. This could lead to a more rapid increase in the number of vegetarians in the U.S.\n\nTaking into account these factors, I estimate the probability of \u22658% of adults in the U.S. self-reporting to follow a vegetarian diet before Jan 1st, 2036, in a major poll of a representative cross-section of U.S. adults to be low.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",

However, there has been a growing trend towards plant-based diets in recent years, with more people becoming aware of the environmental and health benefits of reducing meat consumption.\n\nOn the YES side, there are several factors that could contribute to the increase in the number of people following a vegetarian diet. These include the growing availability of plant-based food options in restaurants and supermarkets, the rise of social media and influencers promoting plant-based lifestyles, and the increasing concern about animal welfare and environmental sustainability.\n\nOn the NO side, the meat industry is a powerful lobby with significant political influence, and there may be resistance to promoting plant-based diets. Additionally, cultural and regional factors may make it difficult for some people to adopt a vegetarian diet.\n\nOverall, I estimate that the probability of \u22658% of adults in the U.S. self-reporting to follow a vegetarian diet before Jan 1st, 2036, in a major poll of a representative cross section of U.S. adults is around 40%.\n\n[Answer] 0.4",

                "On the YES side, it is possible for all five countries to have Queens regnant at the same time before 2100 if there are no changes to their current monarchies. Currently, Queen Mathilde of Belgium, Queen Maxima of the Netherlands, and Queen Letizia of Spain are already in their positions. Additionally, Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden is next in line to the Swedish throne, and the Norwegian monarchy operates under a system of absolute primogeniture, which means that Princess Ingrid Alexandra is next in line to the Norwegian throne. Therefore, it is possible that all five countries will have Queens regnant simultaneously before 2100.\n\nOn the NO side, there are several factors that could prevent this from happening. For example, any of the monarchies could change their succession laws to favor male heirs or to allow for abdication, which could result in a male monarch taking the throne instead of a Queen. Additionally, unforeseen events such as deaths or political upheavals could lead to changes in the monarchies of these countries. \n\nHowever, given the current state of the monarchies in these countries, and the trend towards gender equality in succession laws, I estimate that the probability of Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and Sweden all having Queens regnant simultaneously before 2100 is moderate to high.\n\n[Answer] 0.6",

The Netherlands currently has King Willem-Alexander as its monarch, but he has three daughters who could potentially succeed him. \n\nHowever, there are many factors that could affect the probability of all five countries having queens regnant simultaneously before 2100. For example, the Netherlands may choose to change its succession laws to allow for the eldest child, regardless of gender, to inherit the throne, which would increase the chances of having a queen regnant. Additionally, unforeseen events such as deaths, abdications, or changes in political systems could also affect the probability.\n\nTaking into account all of these factors, I estimate that the probability of all five countries having queens regnant simultaneously before 2100 is relatively low.\n\nHence, I estimate that the probability of Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and Sweden all having Queens regnant simultaneously before the year 2100 is around 20%.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",

However, the global population eventually recovered and continued to grow.\n\nMoreover, the current global population growth rate is slowing down, and some projections suggest that the population will stabilize or even decline by the end of the century, even without a catastrophic event.\n\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of the global population declining by more than 95% relative to the pre-catastrophe population is extremely low.\n\n[Answer] Extremely low",

                "According to UNAIDS, the number of people living with HIV/AIDS globally has been declining since 2010. In 2019, the estimated number of people living with HIV/AIDS was 38 million, which is a decrease from the peak of 38.8 million in 1997. UNAIDS has set a target of 95-95-95 by 2030, which means 95% of people living with HIV/AIDS will know their status, 95% of people diagnosed with HIV/AIDS will be receiving treatment, and 95% of people receiving treatment will have viral suppression.\nAssuming that the current trend continues and the target is achieved, the number of people living with HIV/AIDS globally is likely to continue to decline. However, it is difficult to predict with certainty what the exact number will be in 2037.\nGiven the progress made in HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, as well as the ambitious targets set by UNAIDS, I estimate that the probability of the number of people globally living with HIV/AIDS in 2037 being 36.9 million or more, according to the median estimate from UNAIDS, is low.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",

However, there are many factors that could influence this trend, including changes in funding for HIV/AIDS programs, the development of new treatments and prevention methods, and political and social factors that affect access to healthcare and education.\n\nGiven the current trend and the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV/AIDS, I estimate that the probability of the number of people globally living with HIV/AIDS in 2037 being 36.9 million or more, according to the median estimate from UNAIDS, is low.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",

                "It is difficult to predict the likelihood of the enactment of an anti-discrimination law specifically for genetically-edited or screened federal employees by 2100. As of now, there are no federal laws that specifically address genetic discrimination in the workplace.\n\nOn the YES side, there is a growing awareness of the potential for genetic discrimination and the need for protections against it. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) of 2008 prohibits discrimination in employment based on genetic information, but it does not specifically address genetic editing or screening.\n\nOn the NO side, it is possible that the technology for genetic editing or screening may not become widespread enough to warrant specific legislation. Additionally, the political climate and priorities of the government may not prioritize this issue.\n\nTaking into account both views, I estimate that the probability of an anti-discrimination law being enacted to protect genetically-edited or screened federal employees by 2100 is low.\n\n[Answer] 0.2"

Additionally, NATO countries have strong alliances and diplomatic ties, which could help prevent any conflict from escalating to the use of nuclear weapons.\n\nGiven the risks and consequences associated with the use of nuclear weapons, I estimate that the probability of an offensive nuclear detonation by the US as part of the same conflict is relatively low.\n\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of an offensive detonation by the US as part of the same conflict is around 20%.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",
                "It is difficult to estimate the probability of this event as it is highly unpredictable and depends on various factors. However, we can consider some possible scenarios.\n\nOn the YES side, if a NATO state other than the US detonates a nuclear weapon, it could trigger a chain reaction of nuclear attacks. The US may feel compelled to respond with a nuclear attack to defend its allies and deter further aggression. This could lead to a full-scale nuclear war.\n\nOn the NO side, the US has a no-first-use policy regarding nuclear weapons and has pledged to use them only in response to a nuclear attack. Therefore, the US may not respond with a nuclear attack if the conflict can be resolved through other means.\n\nConsidering the unpredictability of this event and the potential catastrophic consequences, it is difficult to estimate the probability of this event happening. However, based on the current political climate and international relations, I estimate the probability of an offensive detonation by the US occurring as part of the same conflict to be low.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",
                "As an AI language model, I cannot predict the future with certainty. However, I can provide some insights to consider.\n\nOn the YES side, if a NATO state other than the US offensively detonates a nuclear weapon, it could trigger a series of events that lead to a larger conflict involving the US. The US might feel compelled to respond with a nuclear weapon as a show of force or to prevent further escalation.\n\nOn the NO side, it is possible that the US might choose not to respond with a nuclear weapon, depending on the circumstances. The US might instead choose to respond with conventional military force or diplomatic pressure.\n\nOverall, given the unpredictable nature of nuclear conflicts, it is difficult to estimate the probability of this scenario occurring. However, it is worth noting that the use of nuclear weapons is generally considered a last resort due to the catastrophic consequences. \n\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of an offensive detonation by the US as part of the same conflict is low.\n\n[Answer] 0.2"

                "Predicting the political affiliation of elected officials is always challenging because it depends on various factors such as the current political climate, the candidates' popularity, and the issues that are important to voters. However, we can consider some relevant factors to make an estimate.\n\nOn the YES side, historically, Puerto Rico has leaned towards the Republican party. In the 2020 presidential election, the Republican candidate Donald Trump received more votes in Puerto Rico than any other Republican presidential candidate in the island's history. Additionally, if Puerto Rico becomes a state, it is likely to attract more conservative voters who support the Republican party.\n\nOn the NO side, Puerto Rico has been a Democratic stronghold in recent years. In the 2020 presidential election, the Democratic candidate Joe Biden received 62% of the vote in Puerto Rico. Additionally, Puerto Ricans have traditionally supported Democratic policies such as statehood, increased federal funding, and social welfare programs.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, I estimate that the probability of both of Puerto Rico's first two elected Senators being Republicans is low.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",

In the 2020 elections, Puerto Ricans living on the island voted in favor of statehood, which could suggest a shift towards more conservative politics. On the other hand, Puerto Ricans living in the mainland US tend to vote Democratic. \n\nFurthermore, Puerto Rico has traditionally been a stronghold for the Democratic Party, with the current non-voting representative in Congress being a Democrat. However, it is worth noting that political affiliations can shift over time. \n\nGiven these factors, I estimate that the probability of both of Puerto Rico's first two elected Senators being Republicans if Puerto Rico becomes a US state by 2035 is relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.3",

However, some considerations can be made:\n\nOn the YES side, a sudden and significant population decline could lead to a range of negative consequences, such as social unrest, economic collapse, and political instability. These factors could exacerbate existing environmental problems, such as climate change, habitat destruction, and biodiversity loss, and create new ones, such as pandemics, nuclear conflicts, and technological risks. Moreover, a small population could be more vulnerable to stochastic events, such as natural disasters, cosmic impacts, and supervolcanic eruptions, that could wipe out the remaining humans.\n\nOn the NO side, it is not clear that a population decline alone would necessarily lead to extinction within a specific time frame. The human species has survived previous population bottlenecks, such as the Toba catastrophe theory, which reduced the population to as low as 10,000 individuals. Moreover, a smaller population could also have some advantages, such as lower resource consumption, higher social cohesion, and greater resilience to shocks, that could help it adapt to changing conditions.\n\nGiven these considerations, it is difficult to provide a precise estimate of the probability of extinction occurring within 20 years of the human population falling below 400 million.

However, I will provide some perspectives on both sides.\n\nOn the YES side, human-made climate change is already causing significant environmental and societal impacts, including more frequent and severe extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and loss of biodiversity. If these trends continue, they could lead to catastrophic consequences such as large-scale food and water shortages, mass migration, and political instability. Therefore, it is possible that human-made climate change could be the principal cause of a global catastrophe before 2100.\n\nOn the NO side, geoengineering is a relatively new and untested technology that involves large-scale interventions in the Earth's climate system. While it has the potential to mitigate the impacts of climate change, it also carries significant risks and uncertainties, including unintended consequences and potential geopolitical tensions. If geoengineering were to be used on a large scale and something went wrong, it could potentially cause a global catastrophe. However, it is worth noting that the use of geoengineering is not currently widespread and may not be used on a large scale in the near future.\n\nConsidering the above arguments, I estimate that the probability of a global catastrophe before 2100 being principally due to human-made climate change is higher than the probability of it being due to the use of geoengineering.\n\n[Answer] 0.7",
                "It is difficult to estimate the probability of a global catastrophe happening before 2100, as it depends on a variety of factors such as natural disasters, pandemics, geopolitical conflicts, and technological risks.\n\nOn the one hand, human-made climate change is a well-established phenomenon that is already causing significant environmental and social impacts, such as extreme weather events, sea level rise, and biodiversity loss. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned that further warming could lead to irreversible and catastrophic changes in the Earth's system, such as the melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, which would cause a significant rise in sea levels.\n\nOn the other hand, the use of geoengineering as a deliberate large-scale intervention in the Earth's climate system is still a highly controversial and untested approach that could have unintended and unpredictable consequences. Some proposed geoengineering techniques, such as solar radiation management, involve reflecting sunlight back into space to cool the Earth's surface, which could affect regional weather patterns and precipitation, and potentially cause geopolitical conflicts.\n\nConsidering the uncertainties and risks associated with both human-made climate change and geoengineering, I estimate that the probability of a global catastrophe before 2100 being principally due to human-made climate change is higher than that of geoengineering, with a probability of around 70%.\n\n[Answer] 0.7",

These impacts are likely to worsen over time, potentially leading to catastrophic consequences such as mass extinction events, global conflicts over resources, and widespread human suffering. Moreover, some geoengineering technologies, such as solar radiation management, carry significant risks and uncertainties, such as unintended consequences, geopolitical tensions, and moral hazard. Therefore, it is possible that the use of geoengineering could exacerbate rather than mitigate the risks of global catastrophe.\n\nOn the NO side, the use of geoengineering could potentially prevent or mitigate some of the worst impacts of climate change, such as by reducing global temperatures or removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Some experts argue that geoengineering should be considered as a last resort option if other mitigation and adaptation measures fail. Moreover, some catastrophic events, such as pandemics or asteroid impacts, are not directly related to climate change or geoengineering, and could occur independently of human actions.\n\nOverall, I estimate that the probability of a global catastrophe before 2100 being principally due to human-made climate change is higher than the probability of it being due to the use of geoengineering.

The increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, sea level rise, and food and water scarcity are just some of the potential consequences of unchecked climate change.

However, based on current scientific understanding and the risks associated with each scenario, I estimate that the probability of a global catastrophe before 2100 being principally due to human-made climate change is higher than that of the use of geoengineering.\n\nOn the YES side, climate change is already causing significant impacts on the planet, such as rising sea levels, more frequent and intense heatwaves, and extreme weather events. These impacts are projected to worsen over time, leading to food and water shortages, mass migrations, and conflicts over resources. There is also a risk of tipping points in the Earth's system, such as the collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet or the release of methane from permafrost, which could trigger irreversible and catastrophic changes.\n\nOn the NO side, while geoengineering has the potential to mitigate some of the impacts of climate change, it also carries significant risks and uncertainties. Large-scale interventions in the Earth's climate system could have unintended consequences, such as disrupting regional weather patterns, reducing agricultural productivity, or causing geopolitical tensions. Moreover, the deployment of geoengineering technologies could be subject to governance challenges and ethical concerns.\n\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of a global catastrophe before 2100 being principally due to human-made climate change is around 70%.\n\n[Answer] 0.7"

                "This is a difficult question, and there is no clear consensus on the answer. However, here are some arguments for each side:\n\nOn the YES side, human-made climate change is a well-established phenomenon, and there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that it is already causing significant harm to ecosystems and human societies. Climate models also predict that the effects of climate change will become more severe and widespread over time, potentially leading to catastrophic consequences such as mass extinctions, food and water shortages, and displacement of populations. Therefore, it is possible that a global catastrophe could be caused primarily by human-made climate change.\n\nOn the NO side, geoengineering is a relatively new and untested technology, and there is a significant risk that large-scale interventions in the Earth's climate system could have unintended and negative consequences. For example, some proposed geoengineering techniques such as solar radiation management could lead to regional climate disruptions, or even trigger global conflicts over control of the Earth's climate. Therefore, it is possible that a global catastrophe could be caused primarily by the use of geoengineering.\n\nHowever, given the current state of our knowledge and the uncertainty surrounding both human-made climate change and geoengineering, it is difficult to assign a specific probability to either scenario. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of a global catastrophe being caused primarily by human-made climate change or the use of geoengineering is roughly equal.\n\n[Answer] 0.5",

However, I can provide some insights into the two potential causes mentioned in the question.\n\nOn the YES side, human-made climate change is a well-established phenomenon that has already caused significant damage to ecosystems and human societies. Climate models also suggest that if we continue with business-as-usual emissions, we could face catastrophic consequences such as sea-level rise, extreme weather events, and food shortages. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that human-made climate change could lead to a global catastrophe before 2100.\n\nOn the NO side, geoengineering is a relatively new and untested technology that involves large-scale interventions in the Earth's climate system. While some geoengineering techniques, such as afforestation, could have positive effects on the climate, others, such as solar radiation management, could have unintended consequences and lead to a global catastrophe. However, the use of geoengineering is still in its infancy, and it is unclear whether it will ever be deployed on a large scale. Therefore, it is difficult to estimate the probability of geoengineering causing a global catastrophe before 2100.\n\nGiven the uncertainty surrounding both potential causes, I estimate that the probability of a global catastrophe before 2100 being principally due to human-made climate change is slightly higher than the probability of it being due to the use of geoengineering.\n\n[Answer] 0.6",

These impacts could potentially escalate into a global catastrophe, such as a collapse of the global food system, mass migration, or conflicts over resources. Therefore, the probability of human-made climate change being the principal cause of a global catastrophe before 2100 is high.\n\nOn the NO side, geoengineering is still a relatively new and untested technology, and its large-scale deployment could have unintended consequences, such as disrupting regional weather patterns or causing geopolitical tensions. However, the likelihood of a global catastrophe caused solely by the use of geoengineering is relatively low, as most proposed geoengineering techniques aim to mitigate the effects of climate change rather than exacerbate them.\n\nTaking into account both views, I estimate that the probability of a global catastrophe before 2100 being principally due to human-made climate change is around 70%.\n\n[Answer] 0.7",

Therefore, it is possible that human-made climate change could lead to a global catastrophe before 2100.\n\nOn the NO side, geoengineering is still in its experimental stage, and its potential risks and unintended consequences are not yet fully understood. Some proposed geoengineering techniques, such as solar radiation management, could have adverse impacts on regional weather patterns and ecosystems. Therefore, it is unlikely that the deliberate use of geoengineering could cause a global catastrophe before 2100.\n\nConsidering the above arguments, I estimate that the probability of a global catastrophe before 2100 being principally due to human-made climate change is higher than that of the use of geoengineering.\n\n[Answer] 0.7",

                "Germany has set a goal to phase out coal by 2038, which includes a plan to shut down all coal-fired power plants by that year. \n\nOn the YES side, it is possible that some coal plants may still be operational beyond the deadline due to delays in the implementation of the plan. Also, there may be some political or economic factors that could delay the phase-out process.\n\nOn the NO side, Germany has already started shutting down some of its coal-fired power plants and has been increasing its use of renewable energy sources. The government has also offered financial incentives to companies to shut down their coal plants earlier than planned. \n\nConsidering these factors, I estimate that the probability of Germany's net public electricity generated by coal remaining above 1% by 2039 is very low.\n\n[Answer] 0.1",
                "Germany has pledged to phase out coal by 2038, so the question is whether net public electricity generated by coal will remain above 1% by 2039.\n\nOn the YES side, Germany has a history of being cautious about phasing out coal, and the country still has a significant number of coal-fired power plants.\nMoreover, there may be political and economic pressures to delay the coal phase-out, especially if the transition to renewable energy sources proves more difficult than anticipated.\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of Germany's net public electricity generated by coal remaining above 1% by 2039 is around 20%.\n\nOn the NO side, Germany has already taken significant steps towards phasing out coal, with the government setting a clear timeline for the phase-out.\nMoreover, renewable energy sources are becoming increasingly cost-competitive and are likely to replace coal as a primary source of electricity in the coming years.\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of Germany's net public electricity generated by coal remaining above 1% by 2039 is around 80%.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",
                "Germany has set a target to phase out coal-fired power generation by 2038 at the latest. \nOn the YES side, the target allows for some flexibility, and there might be some coal-fired power plants that remain operational beyond 2038. \nHowever, the trend in recent years has been a rapid decline in coal-fired power generation in Germany, with coal-fired power generation falling from 40% in 2018 to 30% in 2019.\n\nOn the NO side, Germany is committed to achieving its climate goals and has already made significant progress in transitioning to renewable energy sources. \nFurthermore, the trend towards renewable energy sources is expected to continue, and coal-fired power generation is likely to become increasingly uneconomical in the coming years.\n\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of Germany's net public electricity generated by coal remaining above 1% by 2039 is very low.\n\n[Answer] 0.1",
                "Germany has set a goal to become climate-neutral by 2045, which means phasing out coal-fired power generation by 2038 at the latest. \n\nOn the YES side, Germany has already made significant progress in reducing its reliance on coal. In 2020, coal-fired power generation fell to a record low of 37% of total electricity production, down from 61% in 1990. \nMoreover, several coal-fired power plants are scheduled to be shut down in the coming years, and the German government has set up a compensation scheme for coal plant operators to phase out their operations.\nTherefore, the probability of Germany's net public electricity generated by coal remaining above 1% by 2039 is low.\n\nOn the NO side, some coal plants might still be needed as a backup for intermittent renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power.\nAdditionally, the transition away from coal might face political and social resistance, especially in regions where coal mining and power generation are significant employers.\n\nOverall, I estimate that the probability of Germany's net public electricity generated by coal remaining above 1% by 2039 is around 10%.\n\n[Answer] 0.1",

                "It is difficult to estimate the probability of a coordinated effort at foot voting intentionally moving 10,000+ residents to a single American state by 2030 as it depends on several factors. \n\nOn the YES side, there is a growing trend of people moving from high-tax states to low-tax states for better economic opportunities and lower cost of living. This trend has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has made remote work more common and allowed people to move away from expensive urban areas. Furthermore, some organizations are actively promoting foot voting, such as the Free State Project, which aims to move 20,000 libertarians to New Hampshire to create a more libertarian society.\n\nOn the NO side, there are several factors that could limit the success of a coordinated effort at foot voting. Firstly, moving to a new state requires significant resources and effort, which may deter many people from participating. Secondly, there may be legal and regulatory barriers to moving large numbers of people to a single state. Finally, it may be difficult to coordinate such a large-scale effort and ensure that everyone is committed to the same goals.\n\nGiven these factors, I estimate that the probability of a coordinated effort at foot voting intentionally moving 10,000+ residents to a single American state by 2030 is relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",
                "It is difficult to estimate the probability of such a specific event occurring, as it depends on various factors such as the feasibility of the coordinated effort, the willingness of 10,000+ residents to participate, and the legal and practical barriers to such a move.\n\nOn the YES side, there have been some recent efforts to encourage foot voting, such as the Free State Project in New Hampshire, which aims to attract 20,000 liberty-minded individuals to move to the state and influence its policies. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in remote work, which could make it easier for people to move to a different state without having to change jobs.\n\nOn the NO side, moving to a different state can be a significant logistical and financial challenge, and it may be difficult to coordinate such a large-scale effort. Additionally, it is unclear if there is enough interest or motivation among 10,000+ residents to participate in such a move.\n\nTaking into account the various factors, I estimate that the probability of a coordinated effort at foot voting intentionally moving 10,000+ residents to a single American state by 2030 is relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",

Additionally, with the increasing availability of remote work, it may be easier for people to relocate to a specific state without sacrificing their careers or livelihoods.\n\nOn the NO side, coordinating such a large-scale effort would require significant resources and organization, and it may be difficult to find a target state that is willing and able to accommodate such a large influx of residents. Furthermore, foot voting is a relatively new phenomenon and it is unclear how many people would be willing to participate in such an effort.\n\nOverall, I estimate that the probability of a coordinated effort at foot voting intentionally moving 10,000+ residents to a single American state by 2030 is relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",

However, this project took more than a decade to reach its goal, and it is unclear if a similar effort could be replicated on a larger scale.\n\nOn the NO side, moving 10,000+ residents to a single state would require significant resources and coordination, which may be difficult to achieve. Additionally, it is unclear if there is enough demand among Americans to move to a single state, and there may be logistical challenges in finding suitable housing and employment for such a large influx of people.\n\nBased on these factors, I estimate that the probability of a coordinated effort at foot voting intentionally moving 10,000+ residents to a single American state by 2030 is relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",

However, as of 2021, only around 4,000 people have actually moved. If a similar effort were made to move people to a different state, it is possible that it could reach the 10,000+ goal by 2030.\n\nOn the NO side, there are many logistical challenges associated with moving such a large number of people to a single state.

The US has also increased its support for Taiwan, including arms sales and high-level diplomatic visits, which could further escalate tensions. In the event of an armed conflict, it is possible that casualties could reach or exceed 100.\n\nOn the NO side, both Taiwan and China have a strong interest in avoiding a full-scale war, which could have catastrophic consequences for both sides and potentially draw in other countries. Additionally, the US and other countries may intervene to prevent a conflict from escalating.

                "This is a difficult question to answer with certainty, but I will try to provide some insights based on different perspectives.\n\nOn the YES side, there are several factors that could increase the likelihood of a civil war in a country with a median age above 30. For instance:\n\n- Economic instability and inequality: Countries with high levels of poverty and inequality are more prone to social unrest and violence, which could escalate into civil war.\n- Political instability: Weak governance, corruption, and lack of democracy can also lead to political instability and violent conflict.\n- Ethnic and religious tensions: Countries with diverse populations, especially those with historical tensions between different ethnic or religious groups, are more vulnerable to civil wars.\n\nOn the NO side, there are also some arguments that could reduce the likelihood of a civil war in such countries. For example:\n\n- Demographic trends: Countries with an aging population tend to have lower levels of violence and more stable societies, as older people are less likely to engage in violent behavior.\n- International cooperation: Increased global interdependence and cooperation could reduce the incentives for countries to engage in violent conflicts, as they would have more to lose from a disruption of trade and diplomatic relations.\n\nOverall, I estimate that the probability of a civil war in a country with a median age above 30 before 2070 is relatively low, around 20%.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",
