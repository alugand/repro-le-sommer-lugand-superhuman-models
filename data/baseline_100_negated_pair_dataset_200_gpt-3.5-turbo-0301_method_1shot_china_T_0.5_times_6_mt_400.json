                "On the YES side, genetic screening is becoming more common, and the technology is advancing rapidly.\nSome genetic disorders and disabilities can be detected through pre-implantation genetic testing (PGT), which allows parents to select embryos without the genetic mutation.\nAs the technology becomes more affordable and accessible, it is likely that more parents will choose to use it.\nAdditionally, there is a growing trend towards delaying childbirth, which increases the likelihood of age-related genetic disorders.\n\nOn the NO side, there are ethical concerns surrounding the use of PGT, and it is not legal or widely available in all states.\nFurthermore, the cost of PGT can be prohibitive, and insurance coverage is limited.\nThere is also a possibility that new technologies will emerge that make PGT obsolete.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, I estimate that the probability of at least 20% of US births being screened as embryos to detect genetic disorders or disabilities by 2050 is around 15%.\n\n[Answer] 0.15",
                "On the YES side, the use of preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) has been increasing in recent years due to advances in technology and a growing demand for it.\nMoreover, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that all women should be offered carrier screening for genetic disorders before pregnancy, which might increase the demand for PGT.\nAlso, some states in the US have mandated insurance coverage for PGT for certain conditions, which might make it more accessible to a wider population.\n\nOn the NO side, the use of PGT is still relatively low and expensive, and there are ethical concerns about selecting embryos based on non-medical traits.\nAdditionally, the US has a diverse population with different attitudes towards genetic testing, which might affect the demand for PGT.\nFurthermore, there might be regulatory barriers and resistance from some groups to the widespread use of PGT.\n\nTaking into account these factors, I estimate that the probability of at least 20% of US births being screened as embryos to detect genetic disorders or disabilities by 2050 is relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",

Some couples may also opt for PGT to reduce the risk of passing on genetic disorders or disabilities to their children, especially if they have a family history of such conditions. Additionally, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that all pregnant women be offered prenatal genetic testing.\n\nOn the NO side, there are ethical concerns around the use of PGT, and some religious and cultural groups may oppose it. The cost of PGT is still relatively high, and insurance coverage for the procedure is not always guaranteed. Moreover, not all genetic disorders or disabilities can be detected through PGT, so it may not be a reliable solution for all couples.\n\nOverall, I estimate that the probability of at least 20% of US births being screened as embryos to detect genetic disorders or disabilities by 2050 is relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.2 or lower",

These factors include the potential for new variants of the virus to emerge, the possibility of reduced adherence to social distancing and mask-wearing guidelines during the summer months, and the fact that respiratory viruses tend to spread more easily in dry, cool air. However, it is important to note that vaccination rates may continue to increase, which could help to mitigate the spread of the virus.\n\nOn the NO side, there is evidence to suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic may become endemic, meaning that it will continue to circulate at a relatively stable level, much like the seasonal flu. In this scenario, it is possible that the peak 7-day average of COVID-19 cases or CLI in Virginia during a summer will not exceed the same peak during the preceding winter.

Firstly, there has been a steady decline in smoking rates in the US over the past few decades, due to increased awareness of the health risks associated with smoking and stricter regulations on tobacco products. Additionally, there has been a trend towards healthier lifestyles in recent years, with more people adopting plant-based diets and engaging in regular exercise.

According to the CDC, the percentage of US adults who smoke cigarettes has decreased from 25% in 1990 to 14% in 2019. This trend is expected to continue as anti-smoking campaigns and policies become more widespread. Similarly, the use of e-cigarettes has also declined in recent years due to health concerns.\n\nOn the NO side, there are still many people who smoke in the United States, and some may continue to do so despite anti-smoking campaigns. Additionally, the prevalence of smoking and sex may be influenced by cultural and societal factors that are difficult to predict.\n\nRegarding sex, there is no clear trend indicating that it will become less prevalent in the US by 2050. While some studies suggest that younger generations are having less sex than previous generations, this may not necessarily continue in the future.\n\nTaking all of this into account, I estimate that the probability of smoking being less prevalent in the US in 2050 than in 2021 is high, at around 90%.

This trend is expected to continue due to increased awareness of the health risks associated with smoking, anti-smoking campaigns, and higher taxes on tobacco products. Similarly, there has been a decline in the number of people having sex in the United States, particularly among younger generations, due to factors such as increased access to birth control and changing social norms.\n\nOn the NO side, there is no guarantee that these trends will continue, and there may be factors that could reverse them. For example, the tobacco industry could mount a successful campaign to promote smoking, or there could be a cultural shift in which smoking becomes more socially acceptable.

The US has also increased military presence in the region, and there have been some military confrontations between the two countries, such as the recent incidents involving US warships in the Taiwan Strait. Furthermore, some analysts argue that the Thucydides Trap, the idea that a rising power (China) will inevitably clash with an established power (the US), makes a war more likely.\n\nOn the NO side, both the US and China have a lot to lose in a war, and both countries are aware of the catastrophic consequences that such a conflict would entail. Moreover, both countries have shown a willingness to engage in diplomatic talks and negotiations to resolve their disputes.

                "SFFA (Students for Fair Admissions) has accused Harvard University of discriminating against Asian-American applicants in its admissions process. The case has been ongoing for several years, and it is unclear when a final decision will be made. However, we can consider some factors to estimate the probability of the Supreme Court finding Harvard's admissions unlawful in SFFA vs. Harvard before 2030.\n\nOn the YES side, there is evidence that Harvard has used race as a factor in its admissions process. SFFA has presented statistical evidence that suggests that Asian-American applicants are held to a higher standard than other racial groups. Moreover, the Supreme Court has previously ruled that race can be used as a factor in admissions but only under strict scrutiny. Therefore, it is possible that the Supreme Court could find Harvard's admissions process to be in violation of this standard.\n\nOn the NO side, Harvard has argued that its admissions process is fair and that race is only one factor among many that are considered. Moreover, the Supreme Court has generally been hesitant to interfere with the admissions policies of universities. Additionally, the current makeup of the Supreme Court may not be favorable to SFFA's arguments.\n\nConsidering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the Supreme Court finding Harvard's admissions unlawful in SFFA vs. Harvard before 2030 is around 20%.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",

The largest nuclear weapon ever tested, the Soviet Union's Tsar Bomba, had a yield of 50 megatons.\n\nAssuming that an offensive detonation occurs, it is highly unlikely that the total yield of nuclear weapons detonated by 2050 will exceed 1000Mt. This is because the number of nuclear weapons in the world has been decreasing, and most countries with nuclear weapons have committed to reducing their arsenals.\n\nMoreover, the use of nuclear weapons is widely regarded as a last resort due to the catastrophic humanitarian consequences and the risk of retaliation.

Secondly, the possession and use of nuclear weapons are subject to strict controls and monitoring by international organizations such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Thirdly, there is a growing global movement towards disarmament and non-proliferation, which reduces the likelihood of any country increasing its nuclear arsenal.\n\nGiven these factors, I estimate that the probability of the total yield of nuclear weapons offensively detonated by 2050 exceeding 1000Mt, if any offensive detonation occurs, is very low.\n\n[Answer] 0.05"

However, if we assume that an offensive detonation occurs, we can consider some factors that might affect the total yield.\n\nOn the YES side, some countries are currently increasing their nuclear arsenals, and tensions between nuclear-armed nations have been rising. In the event of a nuclear conflict, it is possible that multiple countries would use their nuclear weapons, resulting in a total yield exceeding 1000Mt.\n\nOn the NO side, there are several factors that might limit the total yield of nuclear weapons. First, many countries have committed to reducing their nuclear arsenals and promoting disarmament. Second, the use of nuclear weapons would likely result in a devastating global response, making it unlikely that any country would use more than a few nuclear weapons. Third, advances in missile defense technology might limit the effectiveness of nuclear weapons in a conflict.\n\nGiven these factors, it is difficult to estimate the probability of the total yield of nuclear weapons exceeding 1000Mt.

These efforts could lead to a gradual process of reconciliation and eventual reunification. Additionally, many Koreans on both sides of the border have expressed a desire for reunification, and there is a growing sense of shared identity among younger generations.\n\nOn the NO side, there are significant political, economic, and social obstacles to reunification. North Korea's authoritarian regime and nuclear weapons program present a major challenge to any efforts at reunification, and there are concerns about the potential cost of integrating the two economies. There are also cultural and linguistic differences between North and South Korea that could complicate the process.\n\nOverall, while the possibility of reunification cannot be ruled out entirely, there are many obstacles to overcome.

Additionally, the younger generation of South Koreans seems to be more open to reunification than the older generation, which could increase the political pressure for reunification in the future. Finally, the economic benefits of reunification could be significant, especially for South Korea, which could benefit from access to North Korea's natural resources and cheap labor.\n\nOn the NO side, there are still significant political, economic, and social differences between the two Koreas that could make reunification difficult to achieve. North Korea's nuclear weapons program is also a major obstacle to reunification, as it could pose a threat to regional stability and security.

Additionally, there may be a reluctance among journalists and news outlets to report on such claims without sufficient evidence, due to the potential for sensationalism and misinformation.\n\nGiven the lack of credible evidence and the high standards for reporting on such claims, I estimate that the probability of mainstream news media reporting that alien technology has visited our solar system before 2030 is very low.\n\n[Answer] 0.05",

Furthermore, the scientific consensus is that the vast distances between stars make interstellar travel unlikely, and there is no direct evidence of extraterrestrial civilizations.\n\nTherefore, based on the lack of concrete evidence and the scientific consensus, I estimate that the probability of mainstream news media reporting that alien technology has visited our solar system before 2030 is very low.\n\n[Answer] 0.05",

For example, if a particular state were to implement policies that are very attractive to a certain group of people, such as a universal basic income or very permissive gun laws, it could motivate a large number of people to move there. Additionally, if there were a grassroots movement or organization dedicated to promoting such a move, it could help to coordinate and facilitate the process.\n\nOn the NO side, there are several factors that make this scenario unlikely. First, moving to a new state is a major life decision that requires significant planning, resources, and effort. Coordinating such a large-scale move would be a massive undertaking that would require a high level of organization and resources.

In addition, the Trump administration has been pushing for more Arab-Israeli normalization deals, which could incentivize Saudi Arabia to follow suit. \n\nOn the NO side, Saudi Arabia has long been a supporter of the Palestinian cause and has previously insisted on a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict before normalizing relations with Israel.

However, the normalization of relations between the two countries is still a sensitive issue for Saudi Arabia, given the strong public opposition to Israel's treatment of Palestinians.\n\nOn the YES side, if Iran were to acquire a nuclear bomb, it would significantly increase the security concerns of both Saudi Arabia and Israel. In this scenario, Saudi Arabia may see the normalization of relations with Israel as a way to counterbalance Iran's growing power in the region. Moreover, the United States has been pushing for more Arab countries to normalize relations with Israel, and Saudi Arabia may feel pressure to follow suit.\n\nOn the NO side, Saudi Arabia's domestic politics and public opinion are still strongly opposed to normalization with Israel. Moreover, Saudi Arabia has traditionally been a leader in the Arab world and may be hesitant to take such a step without broader Arab support. Additionally, Saudi Arabia may prefer to pursue other means of countering Iran, such as building up its own military capabilities or working with other regional powers.\n\nTaking into account these factors, I estimate that the probability of Saudi Arabia normalizing relations with Israel by 2031 if Iran gets a nuclear bomb by then is relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.3",

However, I will attempt to provide an estimate based on the available information.\n\nOn the YES side, Saudi Arabia and Israel have already taken steps towards normalization of relations, with the signing of the Abraham Accords in 2020.\nSaudi Arabia has also shown a willingness to cooperate with Israel on security issues, particularly in countering Iran's influence in the region.\nIf Iran were to acquire a nuclear bomb, it would likely increase the security concerns of both Saudi Arabia and Israel, potentially leading to greater cooperation between the two countries.\n\nOn the NO side, Saudi Arabia faces domestic opposition to normalization with Israel, particularly among conservative and religious groups.\nAdditionally, Saudi Arabia has traditionally been a leader in the Arab world, and normalization with Israel could damage its standing among other Arab states.\nFurthermore, the timeline of 2031 is relatively short, and it may not provide enough time for normalization to occur, even in the event of increased security concerns.\n\nConsidering these factors, I estimate that the probability of Saudi Arabia normalizing relations with Israel by 2031 if Iran gets a nuclear bomb by then is around 40%.\n\n[Answer] 0.4",
                "It is difficult to estimate the probability of this event, as it involves multiple variables and unknown factors. However, we can consider some points:\n\nOn the YES side, Saudi Arabia has been gradually improving its relations with Israel in recent years, with both countries sharing a common adversary in Iran.\nIf Iran were to acquire nuclear weapons, it could trigger a regional arms race, with other countries in the region feeling threatened and seeking their own nuclear capabilities.\nIn this scenario, Saudi Arabia may see Israel as a potential ally against Iran, and may be more willing to normalize relations.\n\nOn the NO side, Saudi Arabia has traditionally been a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause, and has refrained from recognizing Israel until a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is reached.\nMoreover, Saudi Arabia is a predominantly Sunni Muslim country, while Israel is a predominantly Jewish country, and there may be religious and cultural barriers to normalization.\nFinally, the timeline of 2031 is relatively short, and it may not be enough time for significant changes in the geopolitical landscape.\n\nTaking all of these factors into account, I estimate that the probability of Saudi Arabia normalizing relations with Israel by 2031 if Iran gets a nuclear bomb by then is low.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",
                "The question involves two separate events and their potential relationship, which makes it difficult to estimate a precise probability. However, I can provide some analysis based on the available information.\n\nOn the YES side, Saudi Arabia and Israel have already taken steps towards normalization of relations in recent years, including the establishment of direct flights between the two countries. Also, Saudi Arabia and Israel share a common concern about Iran's nuclear ambitions, and normalization of relations could be seen as a way to counterbalance Iran's influence in the region. Therefore, if Iran acquires a nuclear bomb by 2031, Saudi Arabia may be more likely to normalize relations with Israel as a way to strengthen its own security.\n\nOn the NO side, Saudi Arabia is a conservative Islamic country and has traditionally been hostile to Israel due to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Saudi Arabia may also face domestic opposition to normalization of relations with Israel, particularly from religious conservatives and nationalists. Additionally, Saudi Arabia may not want to risk damaging its relations with other Arab countries that are opposed to Israel.\n\nGiven these factors, I estimate that the probability of Saudi Arabia normalizing relations with Israel by 2031 if Iran gets a nuclear bomb by then is relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.3",

                "It is difficult to predict the actions of nations in response to hypothetical scenarios. However, we can analyze some factors that may influence Saudi Arabia's decision.\n\nOn the YES side, Saudi Arabia has been taking steps to improve its relations with Israel in recent years, including allowing Israeli flights to use its airspace and reportedly cooperating on security issues.\nMoreover, both countries share a common adversary in Iran, which has a history of hostility towards both Saudi Arabia and Israel.\nIf Iran were to obtain a nuclear bomb, it could further destabilize the region and increase the threat to both countries, potentially providing a strong incentive for them to normalize relations.\n\nOn the NO side, Saudi Arabia has traditionally been a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause and has been critical of Israel's policies towards the Palestinians.\nFurthermore, Saudi Arabia's domestic politics are complex, and any move towards normalization with Israel could face significant opposition from conservative elements within the country.\nFinally, it is also possible that Saudi Arabia may choose to pursue other strategies to counter Iran's nuclear capabilities, such as increasing its own military capabilities or seeking closer ties with other regional powers.\n\nGiven these factors, it is difficult to estimate the probability of Saudi Arabia normalizing relations with Israel by 2031 if Iran gets a nuclear bomb by then. However, based on the conservative nature of Saudi Arabia's political system and the potential opposition to normalization, I estimate that the probability of this happening is relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.3"

A score of 7 indicates a \"flawed democracy\", while a score below 7 indicates a \"hybrid regime\" or an \"authoritarian regime\".\n\nOn the YES side, the United States has been experiencing a decline in its democracy score in recent years, dropping from a score of 8.22 in 2015 to 7.92 in 2019.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also raised concerns about the state of democracy in the US, with some critics arguing that the government's response has been authoritarian in nature.\nFurthermore, political polarization and social unrest in the US could potentially worsen in the coming years, leading to a further erosion of democratic norms and institutions.\n\nOn the NO side, the US has a long history of democratic institutions and values, including a free press, independent judiciary, and regular free and fair elections.\nThe Biden administration has also promised to strengthen democratic institutions and norms, which could potentially reverse the trend of declining democracy scores.\n\nTaking into account both views, I estimate that the probability of the United States dropping below a 7 in the Democracy Index by 2040 is around 30%.\n\n[Answer] 0.3"

In theory, he could serve another term, but there is no guarantee that he will.\n\nOn the YES side, Xi has consolidated power significantly since coming into office, including the removal of presidential term limits in 2018. This suggests that he may be able to continue leading China beyond 2022 if he chooses to do so.\n\nOn the NO side, it is possible that Xi may choose to retire or step down from his position in 2022, as is customary for Chinese leaders. Additionally, there may be political or economic factors that could lead to his removal from power before 2030.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I estimate that the probability of Xi Jinping continuing to lead China in 2030 is around 70%.\n\n[Answer] 0.7"

                "Polygamy is currently illegal in all 50 states of the US. On the YES side, there are some arguments that support the idea that polygamy could become legal nationwide by 2050. For example, the legalization of same-sex marriage in 2015 could pave the way for the legalization of polygamy, as some argue that it is a matter of individual choice and freedom. Additionally, some polygamy advocates are actively pushing for the decriminalization of polygamy.\n\nOn the NO side, there are several reasons why it is unlikely that polygamy will become legal nationwide by 2050. Firstly, polygamy is still widely stigmatized and considered taboo in American culture, which could make it difficult to gain widespread public support. Secondly, there are concerns about the potential for abuse and exploitation in polygamous relationships, which could make it difficult to pass legislation legalizing it. Finally, there are also legal and logistical challenges to legalizing polygamy, such as issues related to inheritance, divorce, and child custody.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I estimate that the probability of polygamy becoming legal nationwide in the US by 2050 is very low.\n\n[Answer] 0.1",

There have been several close calls in the past, such as the 1983 Soviet nuclear false alarm incident, which could have led to an accidental launch. Additionally, the risk of cyber attacks on nuclear weapons systems is increasing, which could potentially lead to unauthorized use.\n\nOn the NO side, states with nuclear weapons have strict safety protocols in place to prevent accidental or unauthorized detonation. These protocols include multiple layers of security and control, as well as extensive training and drills for personnel. Furthermore, the consequences of a nuclear detonation are so severe that states are highly motivated to prevent any accidental or unauthorized use.\n\nConsidering these arguments, I estimate that the probability of the first non-test detonation of a state's nuclear weapon by 2050 being accidental/unauthorized is relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",
