Moreover, the probability of detecting such an object within the next few years is also low.\n\nTaking into account both views, I estimate that the probability of a space object with a diameter of no less than 50 meters being spotted on a trajectory set to collide with Earth prior to January 1st, 2100, and the observation being made by January 1st, 2025, is around 5%.\n\n[Answer] 0.05"

                "This is a difficult question to answer with certainty, as it depends on a variety of factors that are difficult to predict. However, we can consider some factors that might influence the likelihood of an accident or unauthorized action leading to a non-test nuclear weapon explosion.\n\nOn the YES side, nuclear weapons are complex and dangerous devices that require careful handling and maintenance. Accidents have occurred in the past, such as the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, which was caused by a combination of human error and design flaws. Additionally, there is always a risk of unauthorized access to nuclear weapons, either by insiders or outsiders, which could lead to their use.\n\nOn the NO side, nuclear weapons are typically subject to strict security protocols and are designed to be difficult to use without authorization. Countries with nuclear weapons are also aware of the risks of accidents and unauthorized use, and take steps to minimize these risks. Furthermore, the consequences of a non-test nuclear weapon explosion would be severe, which provides a strong incentive for countries to take all necessary precautions.\n\nTaking all of these factors into account, I estimate that the probability of an accident or unauthorized action leading to a non-test nuclear weapon explosion before 2050 is relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",
                "It is difficult to estimate the probability of a non-test nuclear weapon explosion by a country before 2050, as it is a rare and catastrophic event. However, we can consider the two possible scenarios:\n\nOn the ACCIDENT side, accidental detonation of a nuclear weapon is a rare event, but it has happened before. For example, in 1961, a B-52 bomber carrying two nuclear bombs crashed in North Carolina, and one of the bombs broke apart, spreading radioactive material. In 1980, a Titan II missile exploded in Arkansas, killing one person and releasing radioactive material. Accidents can happen due to technical failures, human errors, or natural disasters. However, nuclear weapons are designed with multiple safety features to prevent accidental detonation. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of an accidental nuclear weapon explosion is low.\n\nOn the UNAUTHORIZED ACTION side, the risk of unauthorized use of nuclear weapons is a concern, especially in countries with unstable political situations or weak command and control systems. For example, in 2010, a group of Russian nuclear engineers were caught trying to sell nuclear materials to terrorists. In 2012, a Pakistani army officer was arrested for plotting to attack the US with a nuclear weapon. In 2013, a US Air Force officer was convicted of attempting to sell nuclear secrets to Iran. The unauthorized use of nuclear weapons can happen due to rogue actors, insider threats, or cyber attacks. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of an unauthorized nuclear weapon explosion is higher than that of an accidental one.\n\nConsidering the above arguments, I estimate that the probability of the initial occurrence of a non-test nuclear weapon explosion by a country before 2050 being due to an unauthorized action is around 70%.\n\n[Answer] 0.7",

Additionally, there have been instances of unauthorized actions in the past, such as the 2007 incident in which six nuclear warheads were mistakenly loaded onto a B-52 bomber and flown across the United States.\n\nOn the NO side, nuclear weapons are subject to strict safety protocols and are designed to be difficult to detonate accidentally. Additionally, the consequences of an unauthorized detonation would be severe, and countries are likely to take steps to prevent such an occurrence.\n\nGiven these factors, I estimate that the probability of an accident or unauthorized action leading to a non-test nuclear weapon explosion before 2050 is relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.2"

This is because most countries with nuclear weapons have strict protocols and safety measures in place to prevent unauthorized use of their nuclear arsenal.\n\nOn the other hand, unintentional incidents such as accidents or technical failures have occurred in the past, such as the Chernobyl disaster and the Fukushima nuclear accident.

However, assuming such an incident occurs, it is likely that the premier incident will be attributed to an unintentional act rather than an unapproved act.\n\nOn the YES side, there have been several instances in the past where nuclear weapons have been accidentally dropped or mishandled, such as the 1961 Goldsboro B-52 crash and the 2007 incident where a B-52 mistakenly flew with six nuclear warheads on board. These incidents highlight the potential for human error and technical malfunctions that could lead to an unintentional nuclear blast.\n\nOn the NO side, nuclear weapons are highly secure and require multiple levels of approval before they can be used. Additionally, nations with nuclear weapons have strict protocols and procedures in place to prevent accidental or unauthorized use.\n\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of the premier incident being attributed to an unintentional act is around 70%.\n\n[Answer] 0.7",

In the event of an offensive nuclear detonation, it is possible that there could be at least one fatality.\n\nOn the NO side, the use of nuclear weapons is widely regarded as a last resort, and the consequences of their use are well-known and catastrophic. Additionally, there have been efforts to reduce nuclear arsenals and prevent their use through international agreements.\n\nOverall, while the probability of an offensive nuclear detonation is low, the probability of at least one fatality resulting from such an event is high.

However, based on the current state of knowledge and the trends in AI development, it is reasonable to assume that the probability of AI causing a global catastrophe will remain above 5% in each 6-month period before 2040.\n\nOn the YES side, there are several reasons to believe that the probability of AI causing a global catastrophe will remain high. First, AI is becoming increasingly powerful and autonomous, which raises the risk of unintended consequences. Second, there is a lack of understanding and control over how AI systems make decisions, which could lead to catastrophic outcomes. Third, there is a possibility of malicious actors using AI for destructive purposes.\n\nOn the NO side, there are efforts underway to develop safe and beneficial AI, and there is growing awareness of the risks associated with AI. However, it is unclear whether these efforts will be sufficient to mitigate the risks of AI causing a global catastrophe.\n\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of the probability of AI causing a global catastrophe remaining above 5% in each 6-month period before 2040 is around 70%.\n\n[Answer] 0.7",

For example, some experts have warned about the risks of advanced AI systems becoming uncontrollable or misaligned with human values. Additionally, the development of AI is accelerating, and there may be unexpected interactions between different AI systems that could lead to catastrophic outcomes.\n\nOn the NO side, there are also arguments that suggest the probability of a global catastrophe caused by AI will decrease over time. For example, as AI systems become more advanced, they may become better at detecting and avoiding catastrophic outcomes. Additionally, there is growing awareness of the risks of AI, and efforts are being made to develop safety mechanisms and governance frameworks.\n\nGiven the uncertainty and complexity of this question, it is difficult to provide a precise estimate.

                "This is a difficult question to answer with certainty, as it depends on a number of unpredictable factors. However, I can provide some analysis to help inform an estimate.\n\nOn the YES side, North Korea has been actively developing its nuclear capabilities and has conducted several nuclear tests in recent years. The country has also made threats against other nations, including the United States, and has engaged in provocative behavior. If North Korea were to use a nuclear weapon offensively, it is possible that there could be at least one fatality.\n\nOn the NO side, the use of nuclear weapons is widely regarded as a last resort, and the international community has taken steps to discourage their use. Additionally, the consequences of a nuclear attack would be severe, and North Korea's leaders are likely aware of this. It is also possible that North Korea's nuclear program could be disrupted or dismantled before it is able to produce a functional weapon.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I estimate that the probability of at least one fatality from an offensive nuclear detonation in North Korea by 2050, if there's an offensive detonation anywhere, is around 20%.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",

Some people may argue that it is not appropriate to provide legal protections for those who have undergone these procedures, as it may be seen as promoting or condoning the use of these technologies.\n\nOverall, it is difficult to estimate the probability of a law against discrimination being established to safeguard U.S. federal employees who were genetically-edited or screened as embryos by 2100. However, given the current trends and the potential benefits of such a law, I estimate the probability to be around 50%.\n\n[Answer] 0.5"

Additionally, Saudi Arabia has historically been a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause, and any move towards normalization with Israel could be seen as a betrayal of this cause.\n\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of Iran not acquiring a nuclear bomb by 2031 leading to Saudi Arabia normalizing ties with Israel is relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.3"

However, assuming that such an event does occur, the probability of at least one death in China would depend on various factors such as the location and magnitude of the explosion, the direction of the wind, and the preparedness of the Chinese government and its citizens.\n\nOn the one hand, China has a large population and a high population density in many areas, which could increase the likelihood of at least one death in the event of a nuclear explosion. On the other hand, China has invested heavily in its civil defense infrastructure and has a well-trained and well-equipped military, which could mitigate the impact of a nuclear explosion.\n\nGiven the uncertainty and complexity of the factors involved, it is difficult to provide a precise estimate.

The period 1861-1880 is often used as a reference period for pre-industrial levels.\n\nOn the YES side, according to the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report, there is a high likelihood that global temperatures will rise by more than 3.6\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century if no action is taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This means that there is a high probability that there will be a period of at least 5 consecutive years where the average global temperature is at least 3.6\u00b0C greater than the average global temperature relative to the period 1861-1880.\n\nOn the NO side, there is ongoing global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming. The Paris Agreement has been ratified by 189 countries, and many countries have set ambitious targets to reduce their emissions.

Additionally, some clinical trials of senolytic drugs have had mixed results, and there may be safety concerns that need to be addressed.\n\nTaking into account the current state of research and development, as well as the regulatory landscape, I estimate that the probability of a senolytic therapy obtaining FDA approval for commercial use in the US before January 1, 2030, is around 30%.\n\n[Answer] 0.3",
                "Senolytic therapies are drugs that target senescent cells, which are cells that have stopped dividing and are associated with aging and age-related diseases. While there are several senolytic drugs currently in clinical trials, it is difficult to predict when they will be approved for commercial use by the US FDA.\n\nOn the YES side, there is growing interest in senolytic therapies, and several companies are actively developing and testing these drugs. Some of these drugs have shown promising results in preclinical and early-stage clinical trials, and there is hope that they could be effective in treating a range of age-related diseases.\n\nOn the NO side, drug development is a complex and unpredictable process, and many drugs fail to make it through clinical trials or receive FDA approval. Senolytic therapies are still in the early stages of development, and it is possible that they may not prove to be effective or safe enough for commercial use.\n\nTaking into account the current state of research and development, as well as the challenges and uncertainties involved in drug development, I estimate that the probability of a senolytic therapy obtaining FDA approval for commercial use in the US before January 1, 2030, is around 30%.\n\n[Answer] 0.3"

In the 2016 US presidential election, the Republican candidate won the territory's electoral votes. Additionally, the current Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico, who serves as a non-voting member of the US House of Representatives, is a Republican.\n\nOn the NO side, Puerto Rico has a large Democratic Party presence, and the party has been gaining support in recent years. In the 2020 US presidential election, the Democratic candidate won the majority of the votes in Puerto Rico. Furthermore, the political landscape of the US may change significantly by 2035, making it difficult to predict the political affiliation of future Senators.\n\nConsidering these factors, I estimate that the probability of both of Puerto Rico's initial two Senators, elected after becoming a US state by 2035, being Republicans is around 40%.\n\n[Answer] 0.4",

It is unclear whether such a level of fidelity is even theoretically possible, let alone achievable within the next 80 years.\n\nTaking all of these factors into account, I estimate that the probability of computer simulations reaching a level of fidelity by 2100 that would enable them to replicate the physical reality experienced by Metaculus users from 2016 to 2018 with sufficient accuracy to simulate all participation up to the next two years is very low.\n\n[Answer] 0.1",

However, I will try to break it down into different components.\n\nOn the YES side, computer simulations have been improving rapidly in recent years, and there is no reason to believe that this trend will not continue. With advances in computing power, machine learning, and other technologies, it is possible that simulations could reach a level of fidelity that would enable them to replicate physical reality with high accuracy.\n\nOn the NO side, there are several challenges that could make it difficult to achieve this level of fidelity. For example, there are many complex and chaotic systems in the world that are difficult to model accurately, such as weather patterns, ecosystems, and human behavior. Additionally, there may be fundamental limits to the accuracy of simulations, such as the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics.\n\nGiven these factors, I estimate that the probability of computer simulations reaching a level of fidelity by 2100 that would enable them to replicate the physical reality experienced by Metaculus users from 2016 to 2018 with sufficient accuracy to simulate all participation up to the next two years is very low.\n\n[Answer] 0.1",

                "On the YES side, there are several factors that could lead to a decline in college attendance among college-aged U.S. citizens. These include rising tuition costs, student debt, and the availability of alternative education options such as online courses and vocational training. Additionally, demographic trends suggest that the number of college-aged individuals in the U.S. will decline in the coming years.\n\nOn the NO side, there are also factors that could mitigate a decline in college attendance. For example, there may be increased demand for higher education as the job market becomes more competitive and specialized. Additionally, government policies and initiatives could be implemented to make college more affordable and accessible.\n\nHowever, a 50% drop in college attendance among college-aged U.S. citizens by 2040 seems unlikely given the current trends and projections. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the percentage of 18-24 year olds enrolled in college or university in the fall immediately following high school completion was 66.2% in 2011. While there has been a slight decline in recent years, it is unlikely to drop by 50% in the next two decades.\n\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of a 50% drop in college attendance among college-aged U.S. citizens by 2040 is very low.\n\n[Answer] 0.1"

These include:\n\n1. Demographic changes: The number of college-aged individuals in the U.S. is projected to decline in the coming years, which could lead to a decrease in enrollment.\n\n2. Rising costs: The cost of attending college has been increasing faster than inflation for many years, which could make it more difficult for some individuals to afford college.\n\n3.

                "On the YES side, there are several companies currently developing supersonic passenger planes that could potentially make the London-New York trip in less than three hours. For example, Boom Supersonic is developing the Overture, which is expected to have a top speed of Mach 2.2 and could potentially enter service in the mid-2020s. Additionally, NASA is working on a supersonic X-plane that could potentially lead to commercial supersonic travel in the future.\n\nOn the NO side, there are several challenges to commercial supersonic travel, including high costs, noise pollution, and environmental concerns. Additionally, the Concorde, the only supersonic passenger plane to have operated commercially, was retired in 2003 due to high operating costs and declining passenger numbers.\n\nConsidering the current progress in supersonic technology and the challenges that need to be overcome, I estimate that the probability of commercial supersonic travel between London and New York in less than three hours happening at any point before 2030 is around 20%.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",

If the consumption rate continues to increase at the current pace, it is possible that we may run out of at least one of these elements by 2040.\n\nOn the NO side, there are ongoing efforts to find new reserves of these elements and to develop alternative technologies that use fewer or no rare elements. Additionally, recycling and reusing these elements can help reduce the demand for new reserves. Therefore, it is possible that we may not run out of any of these elements by 2040.\n\nTaking into account both views, I estimate that the probability of humanity running out of at least one element currently considered \"under serious threat\" by 2040 is around 30%.\n\n[Answer] 0.3"

Such events could cause significant loss of life and lead to a decline in global population.\n\nOn the NO side, it is difficult to predict the exact nature and severity of an AI failure-mode catastrophe.

However, the fact that the referendum was held at all shows that there is a significant desire for independence among the Kurdish people.\n\nOverall, while it is possible that a successful Kurdish independence movement could emerge by 2030, it is unlikely that a Kurdish state would be admitted to the United Nations as a member state due to opposition from other countries.\n\nHence, I estimate that the probability of a Kurdish state being admitted to the United Nations as a member state by the start of 2030 as a result of a successful Kurdish independence movement is very low.\n\n[Answer] 0.1",

These countries are likely to resist any attempts to create a Kurdish state, and may even use military force to prevent it.\n\nOn the YES side, the Kurdish people have a long history of seeking independence, and have made progress towards this goal in the past. The Kurdish Regional Government in Iraq has already achieved a degree of autonomy, and the Kurdish people have played a key role in the fight against ISIS.\n\nHowever, given the opposition of the countries in the region, it is unlikely that a Kurdish state would be admitted to the United Nations as a member state by the start of 2030.
