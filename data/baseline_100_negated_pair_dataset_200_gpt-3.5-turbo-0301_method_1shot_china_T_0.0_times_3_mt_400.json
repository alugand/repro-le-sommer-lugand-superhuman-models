                "On the YES side, there have been discussions about merging the WTA and ATP tours for several years, and the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated these talks.\nIn December 2020, the WTA and ATP announced a new partnership to collaborate on the marketing and promotion of the sport, which could be a step towards a full merger.\nMoreover, the merger could lead to a more streamlined and profitable tennis industry, which could be attractive to investors.\n\nOn the NO side, the WTA and ATP have different ownership structures and revenue models, which could make a merger difficult to negotiate.\nAdditionally, there are concerns about the impact of a merger on the lower-ranked players, who could face reduced opportunities to compete and earn prize money.\n\nConsidering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the WTA and ATP tennis tours merging before 2031 is relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.3",

Additionally, if there is a low vaccination rate or a mismatch between the vaccine and the circulating strains of the flu, it could lead to a higher percentage of ED and UC visits for ILI.\n\nOn the NO side, it is also possible that public health measures such as increased vaccination rates, social distancing, and mask-wearing could reduce the spread of the flu and lead to a lower percentage of ED and UC visits for ILI.\n\nGiven the unpredictability of the flu and the potential for new strains to emerge, I estimate that the probability of any flu season before 2032 exceeding 14% ED and UC visits being for ILI is low.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",
                "Based on historical data, the percentage of emergency department (ED) and urgent care (UC) visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) during flu seasons has varied widely, with some seasons exceeding 14% and others falling below that threshold. However, it is difficult to predict the severity of future flu seasons.\n\nOn the YES side, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased awareness of the importance of public health measures such as vaccination, social distancing, and mask-wearing, which could help to reduce the spread of influenza as well. Additionally, advances in medical technology and treatment could help to mitigate the impact of severe flu seasons.\n\nOn the NO side, the emergence of new strains of influenza could lead to more severe flu seasons in the future. Additionally, the effectiveness of flu vaccines can vary from year to year, and low vaccination rates could contribute to more widespread outbreaks.\n\nOverall, I estimate that the probability of any flu season before 2032 exceeding 14% ED and UC visits being for ILI is around 30%.\n\n[Answer] 0.3"

However, I can provide some information to consider.\n\nOn the YES side, China has been increasing its diplomatic and economic pressure on Taiwan in recent years, and has refused to rule out the use of force to reunify with Taiwan. However, China has also stated that it seeks peaceful reunification and has offered a \"one country, two systems\" model similar to Hong Kong. It is possible that China could recognize Taiwan's sovereignty under such a model.\n\nOn the NO side, Taiwan has its own government, military, and economy, and has shown no interest in reunification with China. The United States and other countries also support Taiwan's independence, and could potentially intervene if China were to use force. Additionally, recognizing Taiwan's sovereignty could be seen as a major loss of face for China's government and could be politically unpopular.\n\nGiven these factors, I estimate that the probability of China recognizing the sovereignty of Taiwan by 2050 is relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",

However, if such an event were to occur, it is highly likely that it would result in fatalities.\n\nOn the YES side, there is a risk that a non-state actor could acquire a nuclear weapon or the materials to build one, either through theft or illicit trade. There have been instances of nuclear smuggling in the past, and the possibility of a terrorist group obtaining a nuclear weapon cannot be ruled out completely. Additionally, there is a risk of accidental detonation or unauthorized use of a nuclear weapon by a state actor, which could also result in fatalities.\n\nOn the NO side, the security measures in place to prevent nuclear terrorism have been significantly strengthened in recent years, including through the Nuclear Security Summit process. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has also been working to improve nuclear security worldwide.

However, here are some arguments for both sides:\n\nOn the YES side, Saudi Arabia and Israel have been moving closer in recent years, with both countries sharing concerns about Iran's regional ambitions. In September 2020, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates normalized relations with Israel, which could encourage Saudi Arabia to follow suit. If Iran were to acquire a nuclear bomb, this could further increase the pressure on Saudi Arabia to seek closer ties with Israel as a way to counterbalance Iran's power in the region.\n\nOn the NO side, Saudi Arabia is a conservative Muslim country that has traditionally been hostile to Israel, which it does not recognize as a state. While there have been some signs of warming relations between the two countries, a full normalization of ties would require significant political and social changes in Saudi Arabia. Moreover, the acquisition of a nuclear bomb by Iran could lead to a more unstable and unpredictable regional environment, which could make Saudi Arabia more hesitant to take bold steps.\n\nGiven these factors, I estimate that the probability of Saudi Arabia normalizing relations with Israel by 2031 if Iran gets a nuclear bomb by then is relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.3"

                "SFFA (Students for Fair Admissions) has accused Harvard of discriminating against Asian-American applicants in its admissions process. The case has been ongoing since 2014 and is expected to be heard by the Supreme Court in the coming years.\n\nOn the YES side, SFFA has presented statistical evidence that suggests that Asian-American applicants are held to a higher standard than other racial groups in the admissions process. Additionally, the Supreme Court has previously ruled that race can be considered as a factor in admissions, but only if it is used in a narrowly tailored way to achieve diversity.\n\nOn the NO side, Harvard has argued that its admissions process is holistic and takes into account a wide range of factors beyond just test scores and grades. Additionally, lower courts have previously ruled in favor of Harvard, stating that its admissions process is constitutional.\n\nGiven the complexity of the case and the lack of clear precedent, it is difficult to estimate the probability of the Supreme Court finding Harvard's admissions unlawful.
