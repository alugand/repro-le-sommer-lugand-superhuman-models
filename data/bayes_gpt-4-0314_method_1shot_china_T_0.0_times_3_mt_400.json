                "If a major breakthrough in fusion energy is achieved by 2045, it could potentially revolutionize the energy sector and significantly reduce carbon emissions. Fusion energy is a clean, abundant, and safe energy source that could replace fossil fuels.\n\nOn the YES side, a major breakthrough in fusion energy would likely lead to rapid adoption and deployment of this technology, as it would provide a sustainable and cost-effective energy solution. This could lead to a significant reduction in carbon emissions from the energy sector, which accounts for around 73% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, the breakthrough could also spur further innovation and investment in other clean energy technologies, leading to an even greater reduction in emissions. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of global carbon emissions decreasing by 40% from 2020 levels by 2045, given a major fusion breakthrough, is quite high.\n\nOn the NO side, even with a major breakthrough in fusion energy, there could be challenges in scaling up and deploying the technology globally. There might be regulatory, economic, and geopolitical barriers that could slow down the adoption of fusion energy. Furthermore, other sectors, such as transportation and agriculture, also contribute to carbon emissions, and a breakthrough in fusion energy might not directly address these sources. Hence, I estimate that the probability of global carbon emissions not decreasing by 40% from 2020 levels by 2045, given a major fusion breakthrough, is still significant.\n\nTaking both sides into account, I estimate the probability of global carbon emissions decreasing by 40% from 2020 levels by 2045, given a major fusion breakthrough, to be around 75%.\n\n[Answer] 0.75"

Additionally, the renewable energy market share might not grow as fast as expected due to various factors, such as political, economic, and social barriers.\n\nConsidering both sides, I estimate that the probability of the global renewable energy market share exceeding 60% by 2040, conditional on a commercially viable fusion power plant being operational, is around 70%.\n\n[Answer] 0.7",
                "If a commercially viable fusion power plant is operational by 2040, it would be a significant breakthrough in the energy sector. Fusion power has the potential to provide a nearly limitless, clean, and safe energy source.\n\nOn the YES side, the development of fusion power could accelerate the transition to clean energy and reduce the reliance on fossil fuels. The global renewable energy market share, which includes solar, wind, hydro, and other sources, is already growing rapidly. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), renewables accounted for 29% of global electricity generation in 2020, and this share is expected to increase to 43% by 2040 under current policies. If fusion power becomes commercially viable, it could further boost the renewable energy market share.\n\nOn the NO side, the commercialization of fusion power could potentially slow down the growth of other renewable energy sources, as investments and resources might be redirected towards fusion. Additionally, the integration of fusion power into the energy grid might take time, and the global renewable energy market share might not exceed 60% by 2040 due to this delay.\n\nConsidering both sides, I estimate that the probability of the global renewable energy market share exceeding 60% by 2040, conditional on a commercially viable fusion power plant being operational, is around 70%.\n\n[Answer] 0.7"

Age: LeBron will be between 38 and 40 years old during the 2023-2025 seasons. Historically, very few players have maintained MVP-level performance at that age.\n2. Competition: The NBA has a wealth of young talent, such as Luka Doncic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and others, who are likely to be strong MVP contenders during that time frame.\n3. Injuries: As players age, they become more susceptible to injuries, which could limit LeBron's playing time and impact on the court.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I estimate that the probability of LeBron James being named the NBA MVP between 2023 and 2025 is relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.15"

                "Predicting the outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election is challenging due to various factors that can influence the result. Here are some considerations:\n\nOn the YES side:\n1. If President Joe Biden's administration is successful in addressing key issues such as the economy, healthcare, and climate change, the Democratic Party may gain more support.\n2. Demographic shifts in the U.S. population, with increasing numbers of younger and more diverse voters, could favor the Democratic Party.\n3. The Democratic Party has won the popular vote in 7 of the last 8 presidential elections, which may indicate a trend.\n\nConsidering these factors, I estimate the probability of the Democratic Party winning the 2024 U.S. presidential election to be around 60%.\n\nOn the NO side:\n1. The Republican Party may nominate a strong candidate who can appeal to a broad range of voters.\n2. The political landscape can change significantly in the next few years, with unforeseen events or issues that could impact voter preferences.\n3. Midterm elections in 2022 could shift the balance of power in Congress, affecting the political climate leading up to the 2024 election.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I estimate the probability of the Democratic Party not winning the 2024 U.S. presidential election to be around 40%.\n\n[Answer] 0.6",
                "On the YES side, the Democratic Party has a strong base of support in urban areas and among minority groups, which are growing in population.\nThe Democratic Party has also been successful in recent elections, winning the presidency in 2020 and gaining control of both the House and the Senate.\nAdditionally, the Democratic Party may benefit from the ongoing demographic shifts in the United States, such as the increasing number of Hispanic voters.\nConsidering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the Democratic Party winning the U.S. presidential election in 2024 is moderately high.\n\nOn the NO side, the Republican Party has a strong base of support in rural areas and among older, white voters.\nThe Republican Party has also shown resilience in recent elections, maintaining a strong presence in state legislatures and governorships.\nMoreover, the outcome of the 2024 election will depend on various factors, such as the state of the economy, the popularity of the incumbent president, and the candidates nominated by each party.\nConsidering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the Democratic Party winning the U.S. presidential election in 2024 is moderately low.\n\nTaking both sides into account, I estimate that the probability of the Democratic Party winning the U.S. presidential election in 2024 is around 50%.\n\n[Answer] 0.5",
                "Predicting the outcome of an election four years in advance is challenging due to the numerous factors that can influence the result. However, we can consider some factors to estimate the probability.\n\nOn the YES side:\n1. The Democratic Party currently holds the presidency, which could give them an advantage if President Biden or Vice President Harris runs for re-election.\n2. The Democratic Party has been successful in recent elections, winning the popular vote in 7 of the last 8 presidential elections.\n3. Demographic shifts in the U.S. population, such as increasing diversity, may favor the Democratic Party.\n\nConsidering these factors, I estimate the probability of the Democratic Party winning the 2024 election to be around 60%.\n\nOn the NO side:\n1. The Republican Party has a strong base and has shown resilience in recent elections, winning the presidency in 2016.\n2. Midterm elections often result in losses for the incumbent party, which could weaken the Democratic Party's position going into 2024.\n3. Unforeseen events, such as economic downturns or international crises, could negatively impact the Democratic Party's chances.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I estimate the probability of the Democratic Party not winning the 2024 election to be around 40%.\n\n[Answer] 0.6"
