                "It is difficult to estimate the probability of a specific event like an offensive nuclear detonation, especially with the added condition of it happening in a specific country. However, it is important to note that the use of nuclear weapons is widely considered to be catastrophic and the consequences would be severe.\n\nOn the YES side, Russia has a significant nuclear arsenal, and tensions between Russia and other countries have been high in recent years. In addition, accidents and human error have occurred in the past, such as the Chernobyl disaster. These factors increase the likelihood of a nuclear detonation occurring in Russia.\n\nOn the NO side, there have been efforts to reduce nuclear weapons and increase international cooperation on nuclear disarmament. Additionally, the consequences of a nuclear detonation would be severe, and leaders of nuclear-armed countries are aware of this.\n\nTaking into account the risks and efforts towards disarmament, I estimate the probability of a fatality from an offensive nuclear detonation in Russia by 2030, if there's an offensive detonation anywhere by then, to be very low.\n\n[Answer] 0.1",

                "It is difficult to provide a precise probability estimate for this question, as it depends on various factors that are hard to predict. However, here are some considerations:\n\nOn the YES side, if an offensive nuclear explosion occurs anywhere before 2030, it is likely to have a significant impact on global security and geopolitical relations. Russia is one of the world's major nuclear powers, and any nuclear explosion would have serious consequences for its population and infrastructure. It is also possible that Russia could be a target of a nuclear attack, either directly or indirectly, due to its involvement in various conflicts around the world.\n\nOn the NO side, the probability of a nuclear explosion occurring anywhere in the world before 2030 is relatively low, as the number of nuclear weapons and the risk of their use have decreased since the end of the Cold War. Additionally, most countries with nuclear weapons have adopted policies of deterrence and mutual destruction, which have helped prevent the use of nuclear weapons in conflicts.\n\nOverall, while the probability of a nuclear explosion resulting in at least one death in Russia before 2030 cannot be estimated with certainty, it is likely to be relatively low, given the various factors involved.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",

                "This is a difficult question to answer as it involves multiple uncertain factors. \n\nOn the YES side, Pakistan is a nuclear-armed state with a history of political instability and terrorist attacks. The possibility of a terrorist group obtaining a nuclear weapon or the materials to make one cannot be ruled out. Moreover, the use of nuclear weapons in an offensive manner is a significant escalation of conflict, and the likelihood of fatalities is high.\n\nOn the NO side, the use of nuclear weapons is widely considered a last resort, and the international community has taken steps to prevent their use. Additionally, a nuclear detonation would have severe consequences for Pakistan, including potential retaliation from other states and international isolation.\n\nConsidering the uncertainties involved, it is difficult to provide a precise estimate. However, I would estimate that the probability of at least one fatality from an offensive nuclear detonation in Pakistan by 2030, if there's an offensive detonation anywhere by then, is around 20%.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",
                "It is difficult to estimate the probability of such a specific event, but the use of nuclear weapons is generally considered a low probability event due to the catastrophic consequences and the strong deterrent effect of mutual assured destruction.\n\nOn the YES side, Pakistan has a history of instability, political turmoil, and terrorist attacks. Additionally, Pakistan's nuclear arsenal is estimated to be the fastest-growing in the world, and the country has a doctrine of \"full spectrum deterrence,\" which includes the use of nuclear weapons in response to conventional attacks.\n\nOn the NO side, the use of nuclear weapons is widely recognized as a last resort option, and the international community has made significant efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and promote nuclear disarmament. Additionally, the catastrophic consequences of a nuclear detonation make it unlikely that any rational actor would use nuclear weapons offensively.\n\nTaking into account these factors, I estimate that the probability of at least one fatality from an offensive nuclear detonation in Pakistan by 2030, if there's an offensive detonation anywhere by then, is very low.\n\n[Answer] 0.05",

There is a risk that a conflict could escalate to the point of a nuclear exchange, which could result in fatalities. Additionally, Pakistan is believed to have a relatively small and fragile nuclear arsenal, which could increase the risk of accidents or unauthorized use.\n\nOn the NO side, the use of nuclear weapons is widely seen as a last resort due to the catastrophic consequences. Both India and Pakistan have signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty and have committed to using nuclear weapons only in self-defense. Furthermore, there have been several instances in the past where conflicts between India and Pakistan have been resolved without the use of nuclear weapons.\n\nBased on these factors, I estimate that the probability of at least one fatality resulting from an offensive nuclear detonation in Pakistan by 2030, if there's an offensive detonation anywhere by then, is very low.\n\n[Answer] 0.1",

Additionally, international cooperation on counterterrorism has improved, and the US has been successful in disrupting numerous terrorist plots both domestically and abroad. Furthermore, the risk of a large-scale terrorist attack may be reduced by the fact that many terrorist organizations are currently focused on other priorities, such as maintaining control of territory or fighting other groups.\n\nOn the NO side, it is impossible to completely eliminate the risk of a terrorist attack, and some experts argue that the risk of a catastrophic attack remains high. Terrorist groups continue to evolve and adapt, and may be able to find new ways to circumvent security measures. Additionally, the rise of new technologies, such as drones and cyberattacks, may provide new avenues for terrorists to cause harm. Finally, geopolitical instability and the rise of extremist ideologies around the world could increase the likelihood of a terrorist attack.\n\nTaking into account these factors, I estimate that the probability of preventing a US terrorist attack equal to or worse than 9/11 in terms of lives lost through the year 2030 is around 70%.\n\n[Answer] 0.7",

                "It is difficult to predict the exact cause of a global catastrophe that may occur before 2100. However, we can consider the likelihood of human-made climate change or the use of geoengineering as potential factors.\n\nOn the YES side, human-made climate change is a well-established phenomenon with a significant body of scientific evidence supporting its existence and impacts. The Earth's climate system is complex, and the effects of climate change can be difficult to predict, but it is clear that the consequences could be severe and wide-ranging, including extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and food shortages.\n\nOn the NO side, the use of geoengineering as a deliberate large-scale intervention in the Earth's climate system is a relatively new and untested technology. While it has the potential to mitigate the effects of climate change, it also carries significant risks and uncertainties. The unintended consequences of geoengineering could be severe, including changes in weather patterns, disruption of ecosystems, and unforeseen negative impacts on human health.\n\nGiven the current state of scientific knowledge, it is difficult to estimate the probability of either human-made climate change or the use of geoengineering causing a global catastrophe before 2100. However, based on the severity of the potential impacts of human-made climate change, I estimate that the probability of it being the principal cause of a global catastrophe is higher than that of the use of geoengineering.\n\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of a global catastrophe before 2100 being principally due to human-made climate change is around 60%.\n\n[Answer] 0.6",
                "This is a difficult question to answer with certainty, as both human-made climate change and the use of geoengineering could potentially contribute to a global catastrophe. However, we can consider some factors to estimate the probability of each scenario.\n\nOn the YES side, human-made climate change is already causing significant impacts, such as more frequent and severe heatwaves, droughts, floods, and storms. These impacts could lead to food and water shortages, displacement of populations, conflicts, and other social and economic disruptions, potentially escalating into a global catastrophe. Moreover, the continued burning of fossil fuels and deforestation could trigger tipping points in the climate system, such as the melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, the release of methane from permafrost, or the weakening of the ocean currents, which could amplify and accelerate the warming and destabilization of the Earth's climate system.\n\nOn the NO side, the use of geoengineering as a deliberate large-scale intervention in the Earth's climate system is still largely hypothetical and untested. While some proposed methods, such as afforestation, carbon capture and storage, or solar radiation management, could potentially mitigate some of the effects of climate change, they also carry significant risks and uncertainties. For example, solar radiation management could alter regional weather patterns, reduce solar power generation, or cause geopolitical tensions over the control and distribution of the benefits and harms. Moreover, the deployment of large-scale geoengineering could create moral hazard, by reducing the incentives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or adapt to the impacts of climate change, and by creating new environmental and social risks.\n\nConsidering these factors, I estimate that the probability of a global catastrophe before 2100 being principally due to human-made climate change is higher than that due to the use of geoengineering, although both scenarios are possible.\n\nTherefore, my estimate is that the probability of a global catastrophe before 2100 being principally due to human-made climate change is around 70%.\n\n[Answer] 0.7",

These impacts are expected to worsen in the coming decades, leading to significant economic, social, and environmental costs.\n\nOn the NO side, the use of geoengineering to mitigate the impacts of climate change is still largely theoretical and experimental, with many uncertainties and potential risks. There is also a risk that geoengineering interventions could have unintended consequences, such as disrupting regional weather patterns or causing geopolitical conflicts.\n\nGiven the current state of knowledge and the significant risks associated with geoengineering, I estimate that the probability of human-made climate change being the principal cause of a global catastrophe happening before 2100 is very high, around 95%.\n\n[Answer] 0.95",

The scientific consensus is that these effects will only continue to worsen if greenhouse gas emissions are not significantly reduced. This could lead to a global catastrophe in the form of widespread food and water shortages, displacement of populations, and increased conflict.\n\nOn the NO side, deliberate large-scale intervention in the Earth's climate system through the use of geoengineering is still largely theoretical and untested. While some proposed methods, such as carbon capture and storage, may have potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, other methods, such as solar radiation management, carry significant risks and uncertainties. The potential unintended consequences of geoengineering could also lead to global catastrophes.\n\nGiven the current state of knowledge and technology, I estimate that the probability of human-made climate change being the principal cause of a global catastrophe happening before 2100 is higher than that of deliberate large-scale intervention in the Earth's climate system through the use of geoengineering.\n\n[Answer] 0.8",

Moreover, the effects of climate change are already being felt in many parts of the world, and the situation is projected to worsen in the coming decades.\n\nOn the NO side, geoengineering is a relatively untested and potentially risky technology. It involves large-scale interventions in the Earth's climate system, such as injecting aerosols into the stratosphere to reflect sunlight back into space or fertilizing the oceans to increase their ability to absorb carbon dioxide. These interventions could have unintended consequences, such as changing weather patterns or causing harm to ecosystems.\n\nGiven the significant risks associated with geoengineering, I estimate that the probability of human-made climate change being the principal cause of a global catastrophe happening before 2100 is very high, around 95%.\n\n[Answer] 0.95",

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned that global warming beyond 1.5\u00b0C could lead to catastrophic consequences for human civilization and the planet's biodiversity. The current trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions is likely to result in warming beyond 1.5\u00b0C by mid-century.\n\nOn the NO side, large-scale geoengineering interventions, such as solar radiation management or carbon dioxide removal, are still in the experimental stage and have not been tested at a scale that would allow a comprehensive assessment of their risks and benefits. The potential unintended consequences of geoengineering, such as regional climate disruptions or damage to the ozone layer, could also lead to catastrophic outcomes.\n\nConsidering the current state of climate change and the uncertainties surrounding geoengineering, I estimate that human-made climate change is more likely to be the principal cause of a global catastrophe happening before 2100.\n\n[Answer] Human-made climate change is more likely to be the principal cause of a global catastrophe happening before 2100."

The affected country could also have effective emergency response measures in place to minimize casualties.\n\nGiven the high stakes involved, it is difficult to estimate the probability of at least one individual losing their life in the US, UK, or France as a consequence of a nuclear detonation. However, I estimate that the probability is relatively high, around 70%.\n\n[Answer] 0.7"

Additionally, the Metaculus and community predictions suggest that there is a significant chance of AI leading to a global catastrophe.\n\nOn the NO side, the argument is that the probability of a global catastrophe caused by AI may decrease over time as researchers and policymakers become more aware of the risks and take steps to mitigate them. For example, there are efforts underway to develop ethical guidelines for AI and to ensure that AI systems are transparent and accountable. Additionally, the development of AI could lead to significant benefits for society, such as improved healthcare, transportation, and energy efficiency.\n\nGiven these arguments, it is difficult to estimate the exact probability of AI leading to a global catastrophe and whether it will remain constant or change over time. However, based on the available evidence and expert opinions, it seems reasonable to estimate that the probability of AI leading to a global catastrophe will remain above 5% for every 6-month period until 2040, but it may not necessarily remain constant. \n\nTherefore, my estimate for the probability of AI leading to a global catastrophe remaining at 5% or higher for every 6-month period until 2040 is around 70%.\n\n[Answer] 0.7",
                "It is difficult to estimate the probability of a global catastrophe caused by artificial intelligence, as it depends on various factors such as the level of AI development, the degree of safety measures taken, and the potential for human error or malicious intent.\n\nHowever, assuming that the probability remains constant at 5% or higher for every 6-month period until 2040, it would imply that the likelihood of a catastrophic event is relatively high. This prediction is based on the assumption that AI development will continue to progress rapidly and that safety measures will not keep up with the pace of technological advancement.\n\nWhile it is possible that the probability could remain constant or even increase over time, it is also possible that advancements in safety measures and regulations could lower the risk of a catastrophic event. \n\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of AI leading to a global catastrophe remaining constant at 5% or higher for every 6-month period until 2040 is around 30%.\n\n[Answer] 0.3",

However, any offensive nuclear detonation would have catastrophic consequences, including loss of life.\n\nOn the YES side, China has been expanding its nuclear arsenal and modernizing its weapons, which could increase the risk of a nuclear conflict. Additionally, tensions between China and other countries, such as the US, could escalate to a point where a nuclear attack is deemed necessary.\n\nOn the NO side, the use of nuclear weapons is widely considered to be a last resort, and there are international agreements and protocols in place to prevent their use. Furthermore, the consequences of a nuclear detonation would be so severe that it is unlikely any country would risk such an attack.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I estimate that the probability of at least one fatality from an offensive nuclear detonation in China by 2030, if there's an offensive detonation anywhere by then, is very low.\n\n[Answer] 0.1",

These countries have expressed support for Taiwan's defense and have provided military aid in the past. Additionally, any conflict between China and Taiwan would likely have significant implications for regional stability and could prompt international intervention. \n\nOn the NO side, direct military intervention by foreign powers in a conflict between China and Taiwan could escalate the situation and lead to a broader conflict.

Some countries, such as the United States, have already pledged to support Taiwan's self-defense capabilities and have sold military equipment to Taiwan in the past. Additionally, a conflict between China and Taiwan could have significant regional and global implications, which might motivate some countries to intervene to prevent escalation.\n\nOn the NO side, direct military intervention in a conflict with China could be seen as a significant escalation that might risk a larger conflict.

                "This is a difficult question to answer, as it involves geopolitical factors and the decision-making processes of multiple nations. Here are some arguments for both sides:\n\nOn the YES side, Taiwan is a democratic country and a key ally of the United States, which has a history of supporting Taiwan militarily. The U.S. has also recently increased its military presence in the region and has shown support for Taiwan's independence. Other allies such as Japan and Australia have also shown support for Taiwan and could potentially offer military assistance. Additionally, if China were to launch an attack on Taiwan, it could be seen as a violation of international law and trigger a response from the international community.\n\nOn the NO side, direct military support for Taiwan could escalate the conflict and lead to a larger war. China is a major economic power and many countries may be hesitant to risk damaging their economic ties with China by supporting Taiwan. Additionally, some countries may prefer to take a more diplomatic approach to the conflict rather than resorting to military action.\n\nGiven these factors, I estimate that the probability of allied nations extending direct military support to Taiwan in the event of 100 casualties in a confrontation between China and Taiwan before 2050 is around 40%.\n\n[Answer] 0.4"

                "This is a difficult question to answer with certainty as it involves several complex and uncertain factors. However, I can provide some information that might be helpful.\n\nOn the YES side, a nuclear attack on the US would likely result in widespread destruction of infrastructure, including agricultural facilities and equipment, and contamination of land, air, and water. This would make it difficult to maintain current levels of agricultural production, and could lead to significant declines in crop yields. Additionally, the effects of nuclear radiation on plants and soil could persist for years, further reducing yields.\n\nOn the NO side, it is possible that advances in agricultural technology and practices could mitigate some of the effects of a nuclear attack on crop yields. Also, the exact number and location of nuclear detonations would play a significant role in determining the extent of the damage to agricultural areas.\n\nTaking into account the available information, I estimate that the probability of US cereal crop yields declining by ~20% due to a nuclear attack of >100 detonations by 2045 is around 70%.\n\n[Answer] 0.7",
                "The scenario described in the question is a catastrophic one, and it is difficult to predict with certainty how it would affect cereal crop yields in the US. However, we can consider some factors that may influence the outcome.\n\nOn the YES side, a nuclear attack of such magnitude would likely cause widespread destruction of infrastructure, including farmland and agricultural equipment. The resulting fallout and radiation could also contaminate soil and water, making it difficult to grow crops. Furthermore, a significant reduction in the US population would likely lead to a decrease in demand for food, which could in turn lead to a decrease in production.\n\nOn the NO side, it is possible that advances in agricultural technology and practices could mitigate some of the effects of a nuclear attack. Additionally, the US government may take measures to ensure the continuity of food production, such as providing support to farmers and implementing emergency measures to address food shortages.\n\nGiven the magnitude of the scenario and the many uncertainties involved, it is difficult to provide a precise estimate. However, based on the factors mentioned above, I estimate that the probability of US cereal crop yields declining by ~20% in the event of a >100 nuclear detonation attack by 2045 is around 60%.\n\n[Answer] 0.6",
                "This is a difficult question to answer definitively, as it involves a hypothetical scenario that hopefully will never occur. However, I will try to provide an estimate based on available information.\n\nOn the YES side, multiple nuclear detonations in the US would cause widespread destruction of infrastructure and farmland, as well as significant loss of life. The resulting radiation, fallout, and other environmental factors could have long-lasting effects on agriculture and food production. Studies have shown that even a single nuclear detonation could have a severe impact on agriculture and food security, and multiple detonations would likely compound these effects.\n\nOn the NO side, it is difficult to predict the exact impact of such an extreme scenario, as it would depend on many variables such as the location and size of the detonations, prevailing weather patterns, and the ability of farmers to adapt to the new conditions. It is also possible that the US government would take measures to mitigate the effects on agriculture, such as providing alternative sources of food or implementing new farming techniques.\n\nOverall, I estimate that the probability of US cereal crop yields declining by ~20% due to >100 nuclear detonations by 2045 is high, given the potential for widespread destruction and long-lasting environmental impacts.\n\n[Answer] 0.8",

However, assuming that such an attack occurs and that it affects a significant portion of US cereal crop production, it is reasonable to expect a decline in crop yields.\n\nStudies have shown that high levels of radiation can have a detrimental effect on crop growth and yield. A 20% decline in cereal crop yields may be a conservative estimate, as the impact of a nuclear attack on the US would likely be catastrophic and widespread.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, I estimate that the probability of US cereal crop yields declining by ~20% following an attack by >100 nuclear detonations by 2045 is high.\n\n[Answer] 0.8",

With over 100 detonations, the impact on cereal crop yields across the US would likely be severe.\n\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of US cereal crop yields declining by ~20% due to over 100 nuclear detonations by 2045 is very high.\n\n[Answer] 0.9",

Nuclear detonations could cause significant damage to the environment, including soil contamination, which would likely affect crop yields. Additionally, if the US is attacked by over 100 nuclear detonations, it is likely that the country's infrastructure and economy would be severely damaged, which could further impact agriculture and food production.\n\nOn the NO side, it is possible that the US government could take measures to protect the country's agriculture and food supply in the event of a nuclear attack. For example, the government could invest in new technologies to improve crop yields or provide subsidies to farmers to encourage them to continue producing food.

                "It is difficult to estimate the probability of a nuclear exchange between Russia and the US by 2035, as it depends on various factors and events that may occur in the future. However, if New START is renewed or replaced by another similar treaty after February 2026, it would likely reduce the risk of a nuclear exchange between the two countries, as the treaty limits the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads and delivery systems.\n\nOn the YES side, tensions between the US and Russia have been increasing in recent years, and there have been concerns about the possibility of a nuclear exchange between the two countries. Moreover, the renewal or replacement of New START may not be sufficient to prevent a nuclear exchange, as it does not cover non-strategic nuclear weapons, which could still be used in a conflict.\n\nOn the NO side, both the US and Russia have shown a commitment to arms control and reducing the risk of a nuclear exchange. Additionally, the renewal or replacement of New START could lead to further negotiations on arms control, which may reduce the risk of a nuclear exchange. \n\nTaking into account these factors, I estimate that the probability of a nuclear exchange between Russia and the US by 2035, conditional on New START being renewed or replaced by another similar treaty after February 2026, is around 5%.\n\n[Answer] 0.05",

However, the probability of such an event happening is not zero.\n\nOn the YES side, there are several factors that could increase the probability of a nuclear exchange, such as a miscalculation or miscommunication between the two countries, a terrorist attack on a nuclear facility, or the development of new and more advanced nuclear weapons that could increase the temptation to use them.\n\nOn the NO side, the renewal or replacement of New START or a similar treaty would signal a continued commitment to arms control and reduction, which could help reduce tensions and the risk of nuclear conflict. Additionally, both countries have shown a willingness to engage in diplomatic efforts to resolve conflicts in the past.\n\nGiven the low likelihood of a nuclear exchange and the potential benefits of arms control and reduction, I estimate that the probability of a nuclear exchange between Russia and the US by 2035 conditional on New START being renewed or replaced by another similar treaty after February 2026 is very low.\n\n[Answer] 0.1",

Additionally, efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change may help to limit future warming.\n\nHowever, given the current trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions and the limited progress made in reducing them, it is likely that the global temperature will continue to rise significantly in the coming decades.

                "This question is related to the global warming trend and its impact on temperature rise. \nOn the YES side, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has projected that global temperatures will continue to rise in the coming years due to increasing greenhouse gas emissions, and the world is currently not on track to meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5\u02daC above pre-industrial levels.\nMoreover, the current rate of warming is already approaching 1.5\u02daC, and some climate models predict that the 3.6\u02daC threshold could be reached as early as the 2040s.\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of there being a period of at least five consecutive years with an average global temperature of at least 3.6\u02daC greater than the period of 1861-1880 is high.\n\nOn the NO side, there is still some uncertainty in climate models and the exact timing of temperature thresholds.

According to the IPCC, the warming from pre-industrial levels has already reached 1.1\u00b0C.\n\nOn the YES side, the current trend in global warming is indicating an increase of approximately 0.2\u00b0C per decade. If this trend continues, there is a possibility that the average global temperature could increase by 3.6\u00b0C by 2100, or even earlier. Additionally, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is still increasing, which could further contribute to global warming.\n\nOn the NO side, there are efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and many countries have set targets to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Additionally, there is ongoing research and development in renewable energy and carbon capture technologies, which could help mitigate global warming.\n\nConsidering both views, I estimate that the probability of there being a period of at least five consecutive years by the year 2100, where the average global temperature in each year will be at least 3.6\u00b0C greater than the average global temperature during the period of 1861-1880, is low.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",

                "On the YES side, there are several factors that could lead to a decline in college enrollment in the United States. One is the increasing cost of college education, which has been rising faster than inflation for many years. This could make it difficult for many families to afford to send their children to college. Another factor is the rise of alternative education options such as online courses and vocational training programs, which may be more affordable and accessible than traditional college education. Additionally, demographic changes, such as a declining birth rate, could lead to a smaller pool of college-aged students.\n\nOn the NO side, there are also several factors that could mitigate a decline in college enrollment. One is the continued importance of a college degree in the job market, which could incentivize students to pursue higher education despite rising costs. Additionally, government policies such as financial aid programs could make college more affordable for low-income students. Finally, colleges and universities may adapt to changing student needs and preferences by offering more flexible and affordable options for postsecondary education.\n\nOverall, it is difficult to predict with certainty whether the share of U.S. college-aged citizens participating in postsecondary education within the United States will decline by no less than 50% from its 2011 figure by 2040. However, given the various factors on both sides, I estimate that the probability of such a decline is relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",

Moreover, the US GDP is expected to continue growing, which would make it even more difficult for any individual to reach the 2% mark.\n\nConsidering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the world's wealthiest individual possessing a net worth equal to or exceeding 2% of the United States' GDP during 2033 is very low.\n\n[Answer] 0.1",
                "As of 2021, the wealthiest individual in the world is Elon Musk, with a net worth of around $190 billion. The United States' GDP in 2020 was approximately $21.4 trillion. Therefore, Musk's net worth is currently around 0.89% of the United States' GDP. \n\nAssuming a GDP growth rate of around 2% per year, the United States' GDP in 2033 would be approximately $28.9 trillion. For an individual's net worth to reach 2% of that amount, it would need to be around $578 billion.\n\nIt is difficult to predict the future net worth of any individual, but it is worth noting that the world's wealthiest individuals have generally seen their net worths increase significantly over the past few decades. However, it is also worth considering the potential for changes in economic policies and regulations that could impact the accumulation of wealth.\n\nOverall, while it is possible that the world's wealthiest individual could reach a net worth of $578 billion or more by 2033, I estimate the probability of this happening to be relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",

However, this growth rate would have to be significantly higher than the growth rate of the US GDP.\n\nOn the NO side, it is unlikely that any individual's net worth would grow at a rate that would result in it exceeding 2% of the US GDP by 2033. Such a net worth would be around $600 billion, which is more than three times the current net worth of the world's wealthiest individual.\n\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of the world's wealthiest individual possessing a net worth equal to or exceeding 2% of the US GDP in 2033 is very low.\n\n[Answer] 0.1",

However, we can consider some factors that could influence the outcome.\n\nOn the YES side, the US has a policy of extended deterrence, which means that it has pledged to use nuclear weapons to defend its allies. If a NATO state were to be attacked with nuclear weapons, the US might feel compelled to respond with a nuclear strike to uphold its commitment to defend its allies. Additionally, the US has a history of responding to nuclear attacks with nuclear retaliation, as seen in its response to the Japanese attacks on Pearl Harbor during World War II.\n\nOn the NO side, the use of nuclear weapons is generally considered a last resort, and the US has expressed a commitment to reducing the role of nuclear weapons in its defense strategy. Additionally, there are diplomatic and strategic considerations that could influence the US response, such as the potential for escalation and the impact on international relations.\n\nOverall, predicting the likelihood of an offensive nuclear detonation by the US in response to a NATO ally's offensive detonation is challenging. However, considering the US's policy of extended deterrence and historical precedent, I estimate the probability of an offensive detonation by the US as part of the same conflict to be around 30%.\n\n[Answer] 0.3",

NATO countries have pledged to defend each other, and an attack by one member could be considered an attack on all. If a NATO state other than the US offensively detonates a nuclear weapon, the US might feel compelled to respond with its own nuclear weapons as part of the same conflict.\n\nOn the NO side, the use of nuclear weapons is widely regarded as a last resort due to the catastrophic consequences of nuclear war. The US has a policy of no first use of nuclear weapons, meaning it will only use them in response to a nuclear attack. It is also possible that diplomatic efforts and international pressure could prevent a nuclear conflict from escalating.\n\nGiven the highly speculative nature of this question and the lack of clear data or evidence, it is impossible to provide a precise probability estimate.

However, I can provide some analysis to help inform a probability estimate.\n\nOn the YES side, if a NATO state other than the US were to offensively detonate a nuclear weapon, the US might feel compelled to respond with a nuclear strike of its own. This could be seen as necessary for maintaining the credibility of the US's nuclear deterrent, and for demonstrating its commitment to the defense of NATO allies. Additionally, the US has a history of responding to nuclear attacks with nuclear retaliation, as seen in its response to the Japanese attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in World War II.\n\nOn the NO side, the US might be hesitant to respond with a nuclear strike, especially if the detonation by the other NATO state was not seen as an existential threat to the US itself. The US might also be reluctant to escalate a conflict to the nuclear level, given the catastrophic consequences that could result.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I estimate that the probability of an offensive detonation by the US occurring as part of the same conflict is relatively low.

The US, as the leading member of NATO, might feel compelled to respond with an offensive detonation as part of the same conflict. Additionally, the US has a doctrine of \"extended deterrence\" which means that it provides a nuclear umbrella for its allies, and a nuclear attack on a NATO state could be seen as an attack on the US itself.\n\nOn the NO side, the use of nuclear weapons is widely perceived as a last resort, and there are strong norms against their use. The US has a policy of \"no first use\" of nuclear weapons, which means that it will not use them unless it is attacked with nuclear weapons first.

                "Assuming the human population reduces to below 400 million by 2100, it is difficult to predict with certainty whether this will lead to extinction within the subsequent 20-year period. However, it is important to consider that the current global population is around 7.8 billion and is projected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050. A reduction to below 400 million would represent a drastic decrease in population.\n\nOn the YES side, a population decline of this magnitude could lead to significant challenges such as a lack of genetic diversity, limited workforce, and a decline in technological advancements. These factors could lead to a decline in food production and healthcare, which could ultimately result in extinction.\n\nOn the NO side, a reduced population could lead to a decrease in resource consumption and a more sustainable way of life. With fewer people, there would be less competition for resources and a reduced impact on the environment. Additionally, advancements in technology could help mitigate the challenges posed by a smaller population.\n\nOverall, while it is difficult to predict with certainty, I estimate that the probability of extinction within the subsequent 20-year period following a reduction to below 400 million by 2100 is low.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",
                "It is difficult to estimate the probability of human extinction within a specific 20-year period, as it depends on many factors that are highly uncertain. However, assuming that the human population reduces to below 400 million by 2100, it is unlikely that extinction will occur within the subsequent 20-year period.\n\nOn the YES side, a population of 400 million is relatively small, and could be vulnerable to catastrophic events such as pandemics, nuclear war, or environmental disasters. Moreover, a small population might struggle to maintain genetic diversity, which could lead to reduced fitness and increased susceptibility to disease.\n\nOn the NO side, a population of 400 million is still substantial, and would likely be distributed across many regions and countries, making it less vulnerable to localized disasters. Moreover, technological advances could help mitigate many of the risks facing a small population, such as disease and environmental degradation. Finally, history has shown that human populations have recovered from catastrophic events in the past, such as the Black Death in the 14th century.\n\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of human extinction within a 20-year period following a population reduction to below 400 million by 2100 is relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",

China has also been increasing its military presence in the region, including conducting military exercises near Taiwan. If a conflict were to break out, it could potentially lead to casualties on both sides.\n\nOn the NO side, both Taiwan and China have shown a willingness to engage in diplomatic talks and negotiations, and have avoided direct military conflict for several decades.

Additionally, the Amazon rainforest, which is a crucial carbon sink, has experienced a record number of fires in recent years.\n\nHowever, it is difficult to estimate the probability of wildfires destroying more than 10 million hectares of global tree cover in any given year, as it depends on various factors such as climate change, forest management practices, and human activities.\n\nBased on the available information, I estimate that the probability of wildfires destroying more than 10 million hectares of global tree cover in any given year before 2030 is around 20%.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",
                "On the YES side, the frequency and severity of wildfires have been increasing globally due to climate change, deforestation, and land-use change.\nAccording to some reports, wildfires destroyed more than 13 million hectares of forest in 2020 alone, including the devastating wildfires in Australia and the western United States.\nIf this trend continues, it is possible that wildfires could be responsible for the annihilation of an excess of 10 million hectares of global tree cover in any given year before 2030.\n\nOn the NO side, many countries have implemented measures to prevent and control wildfires, such as early warning systems, fire suppression techniques, and forest management practices.\nMoreover, global reforestation efforts have been gaining momentum in recent years, with many countries pledging to plant millions of trees to combat climate change.\nTherefore, it is possible that these efforts could offset the damage caused by wildfires to some extent.\n\nOverall, while the probability of such an event occurring is difficult to estimate, I would say that it is relatively low, given the global efforts to prevent and mitigate wildfires.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",
                "On the YES side, there is evidence that wildfires are becoming more frequent and severe due to climate change, which could lead to the destruction of large areas of forest.\nFor instance, the 2019-2020 Australian bushfires burned over 18 million hectares of land, including forests.\nMoreover, deforestation is a major contributor to climate change, and it can increase the risk of wildfires in some areas.\nTherefore, it is possible that wildfires could destroy more than 10 million hectares of forest in a single year before 2030.\n\nOn the NO side, it is difficult to predict the exact extent of future wildfires, as it depends on various factors such as weather patterns and human intervention.\nFurthermore, many countries have implemented measures to prevent and control wildfires, such as early warning systems and firefighting resources.\nTherefore, it is not very likely that wildfires will destroy more than 10 million hectares of forest in a single year before 2030.\n\nHence, I estimate that the probability of wildfires destroying more than 10 million hectares of forest in a single year before 2030 is around 20%.\n\n[Answer] 0.2"

                "On the YES side, there is a growing trend towards the legalization of marijuana in the US. As of November 2020, 15 states and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational marijuana use, and several others have decriminalized it. Some Republican-led states have also shown signs of loosening their marijuana laws, such as Oklahoma, which has legalized medical marijuana. Additionally, public opinion towards marijuana legalization has been steadily shifting, with a majority of Americans now supporting it.\n\nOn the NO side, there is still significant opposition to marijuana legalization in many conservative and Republican-led states. Some states have even rolled back their marijuana laws in recent years, such as Idaho, which passed a law in 2021 making it more difficult to legalize marijuana. \n\nOverall, while the trend towards legalization is positive, it may take some time for heavily Republican states to follow suit.

Historical examples such as the Chernobyl disaster have shown that nuclear accidents can have long-term negative effects on human health and the environment, which could lead to a decline in population growth. Additionally, the psychological impact of a global nuclear catastrophe could lead to a decline in birth rates and an increase in mortality rates.\n\nOn the NO side, there have been no previous global nuclear catastrophes, so it is difficult to predict the exact impact it would have on population growth.

Additionally, both countries share a common interest in countering Iran's influence in the region.\n\nOn the NO side, Saudi Arabia has a history of supporting the Palestinian cause and has previously stated that normalization with Israel is contingent on a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Additionally, the Saudi public is generally not supportive of normalization with Israel.\n\nOverall, it is difficult to estimate the probability of this event, but given the recent developments and common interests between the two countries, I estimate the probability to be around 40%.\n\n[Answer] 0.4",

Saudi Arabia and Israel also share a common enemy in Iran, which could incentivize them to work towards normalizing relations.\n\nOn the NO side, Saudi Arabia has historically been a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause and has refrained from officially recognizing Israel. Additionally, the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Iran is a key factor in the region's geopolitics, and if Iran obtains a nuclear bomb, it could lead to further tensions and make it more difficult for Saudi Arabia to normalize relations with Israel.\n\nOverall, I estimate that the probability of Saudi Arabia normalizing relations with Israel by 2031 if Iran does not get a nuclear bomb by then is around 30%.\n\n[Answer] 0.3",

This could make it an attractive acquisition target for a publicly traded company looking to expand its offerings in the data analytics or prediction markets space. Additionally, the rise of decentralized prediction markets could lead to the development of licensed derivatives of Metaculus that could be operated as public sites by a publicly traded company.\n\nOn the NO side, Metaculus may choose to remain independent and privately owned, or may not attract the attention of any potential acquirers or partners. Additionally, regulatory challenges or legal barriers could make it difficult for a publicly traded company to operate a licensed derivative of Metaculus as a public site.\n\nTaking into account these factors, I estimate that the probability of Metaculus, or a licensed derivative, being operated as a public site by a publicly traded company by 2030 is around 30%.\n\n[Answer] 0.3",

Additionally, if the moon has a stable environment and a protective atmosphere, it could provide a suitable habitat for macrofauna to thrive.\n\nOn the NO side, it is also possible that life on this moon is limited to simple microorganisms, or that the environmental conditions are too harsh for macrofauna to survive. Furthermore, even if there is macrofauna present, it is uncertain whether we will be able to detect it with our current technology.\n\nGiven the high level of uncertainty, I estimate that the probability of finding indications of macrofauna on a frosty moon of gas giants where we locate life by 2200 is low.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",

Macrofauna typically require a stable environment with a source of energy and nutrients, as well as a sufficient atmosphere to support respiration.

This is because the pre-disaster population levels are projected to reach around 11 billion by 2100, and a 10% reduction would still leave a population of over 9 billion people.\n\nFurthermore, even in the worst-case scenarios, it is unlikely that the disaster would cause a reduction of more than 95% in the global population.

However, I can provide some analysis based on past events and current trends.\n\nOn the YES side, it is possible that a disaster could occur that would reduce the global population by at least 10% by 2100. Past pandemics, wars, and natural disasters have caused significant population declines in certain regions. Additionally, the possibility of a catastrophic event such as a large asteroid impact or supervolcano eruption cannot be completely ruled out.\n\nOn the NO side, it is unlikely that a disaster would cause a population decline of more than 95% relative to pre-disaster levels. Such a catastrophic event would likely require the near-extinction of the human species, which is highly unlikely given our current level of technological development. Additionally, even if a disaster were to occur, it is likely that some pockets of human civilization would survive and eventually recover.\n\nTaking into account these factors, I estimate that the probability of a disaster reducing the world's population by at least 10% by 2100 is moderate, around 50%.

The endowment also benefits from a large and diverse pool of assets, including private equity, hedge funds, and real estate. In addition, inflation rates have been relatively low in recent decades, which could help the endowment's purchasing power.\n\nOn the NO side, there are several factors that could limit the growth of the endowment over the next century. For example, the endowment's investment strategy may need to change to account for changing market conditions, and it may face increased competition from other institutional investors.

Additionally, the ascent stage may have been damaged or destroyed during its journey through space, making it impossible to retrieve.\n\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of the lost ascent stage of the Apollo 10 Lunar Module being successfully tracked down, seized, and physically moved to a location where humans can be found by January 1, 2050, is very low.\n\n[Answer] 0.1"
