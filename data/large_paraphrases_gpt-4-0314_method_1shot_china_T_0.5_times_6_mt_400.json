Advances in technology and global cooperation could lead to the development of effective countermeasures, preventing the catastrophe from causing a population reduction of greater than 95%.\n\nConsidering these factors, it is difficult to predict the exact outcome of a nanotechnology catastrophe. However, given the potential for effective countermeasures and global cooperation, I estimate that the probability of the global population diminishing by greater than 95% in relation to the population before the catastrophe occurred is relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",

                "Considering human-made climate change:\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned that we are already experiencing the impacts of climate change, and these impacts will become more severe if global warming continues at the current rate. As a result, there is a significant risk of global catastrophes occurring due to human-made climate change, such as extreme weather events, food and water scarcity, and mass displacement of populations. Given the current trajectory of global emissions and the slow pace of international climate action, the probability of a global catastrophe related to human-made climate change is relatively high.\n\nConsidering geoengineering:\nGeoengineering, or deliberate large-scale intervention in the Earth's climate system, is still in its early stages of development and research. While some forms of geoengineering have the potential to mitigate the impacts of climate change, they also carry risks of unintended consequences and global catastrophes. The likelihood of a global catastrophe caused by geoengineering depends on the scale and type of interventions, as well as the level of international cooperation and regulation. At this point, the probability of a global catastrophe resulting from geoengineering seems lower than that of human-made climate change, mainly due to the limited deployment and uncertainty surrounding these technologies.\n\nTaking both factors into account, I would estimate the probability of a global catastrophe happening before 2100 being caused by human-made climate change to be higher than the probability of it being caused by geoengineering.\n\n[Answer] 0.7",
                "Considering human-made climate change:\nThe scientific consensus is that human-made climate change is real and happening now. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states that there is a high likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems if global temperatures increase more than 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. The Paris Agreement aims to limit global warming to well below 2\u00b0C, preferably 1.5\u00b0C. However, current national commitments are not enough to achieve these goals, and the world is on track for a temperature increase of around 3\u00b0C by 2100.\n\nConsidering geoengineering:\nGeoengineering refers to large-scale interventions in the Earth's climate system to counteract climate change. These interventions include solar radiation management and carbon dioxide removal. While these technologies are being researched, they are not yet widely implemented and have unknown long-term consequences. There is a risk of unintended side effects, and some experts argue that geoengineering could lead to geopolitical conflicts.\n\nEstimating probabilities:\nThe probability of a global catastrophe caused by human-made climate change is higher than that of geoengineering, given the current trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions and the lack of adequate climate action. I estimate the probability of a catastrophe caused by human-made climate change to be around 70%.\n\nThe probability of a global catastrophe caused by geoengineering is lower, as these technologies are not yet widely implemented and have unknown long-term consequences. However, there is still a risk, and I estimate the probability of a catastrophe caused by geoengineering to be around 10%.\n\nConsidering both probabilities, I estimate that the probability of a global catastrophe happening before 2100 being caused by either human-made climate change or geoengineering is around 80%.\n\n[Answer] 0.8",

In the worst-case scenario, the AI catastrophe could lead to a global war or other severe conflicts. Considering these factors, there is a possibility of a decline exceeding 95% relative to the pre-disaster population.\n\nOn the NO side, it is important to consider humanity's resilience and adaptability in the face of disasters. While a 10% decline in global population due to an AI catastrophe is significant, it may not necessarily lead to a 95% decline. Governments, international organizations, and communities could work together to mitigate the impacts of the catastrophe, rebuild essential infrastructure, and maintain stability. Additionally, technological advancements and innovations could help address the challenges posed by the AI catastrophe.\n\nTaking both perspectives into account, I estimate that the probability of the total population experiencing a decline exceeding 95% relative to the pre-disaster population is relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.15"

                "On the YES side, a worldwide biological disaster could cause a cascade of events that exacerbate the population decline. These events might include the collapse of healthcare systems, food shortages, and economic crises.\nIn this scenario, a more than 95% decrease in population could be possible if the disaster is severe enough or if it triggers a series of catastrophic events.\nTherefore, I estimate the probability of a more than 95% decrease in population, given a 10% minimum reduction, to be relatively low.\n\nOn the NO side, a 10% reduction in the global population is already a significant decline. However, it is not enough to cause a 95% decrease in population.\nHumanity has shown resilience in the face of disasters, and it is likely that measures would be taken to mitigate the effects of the catastrophe and prevent further population decline.\nAdditionally, technological advancements and international cooperation could help to stabilize the situation and prevent such a drastic decrease in population.\nTherefore, I estimate the probability of a more than 95% decrease in population, given a 10% minimum reduction, to be very low.\n\n[Answer] 0.05",
                "Assuming a worldwide biological disaster occurs, leading to a minimum 10% reduction in the global population by 2100, we can consider two scenarios: one where the population decrease is between 10% and 95%, and another where the population decrease is more than 95%.\n\nOn the side of a 10%-95% decrease, we can consider the following factors:\n1. International cooperation and preparedness may help mitigate the impact of the disaster.\n2. Advances in medical technology and healthcare infrastructure may help reduce mortality rates.\n3. Governments and organizations may implement measures to control the spread of the catastrophe.\n4. A gradual recovery of the population may be possible after the initial disaster.\n\nOn the side of more than 95% decrease, we can consider the following factors:\n1. The disaster might be so severe that it overwhelms global response capabilities.\n2. The catastrophe may lead to cascading effects, such as food shortages, economic collapse, and social unrest.\n3. Secondary disasters or long-lasting consequences may hinder population recovery.\n\nGiven the potential for global cooperation, medical advances, and containment measures, the probability of a more than 95% decrease in population seems low. Therefore, I estimate the probability of a more than 95% decrease in population compared to before the catastrophe to be around 10%.\n\n[Answer] 0.1",

Such an event could lead to a collapse of social, economic, and political systems, further exacerbating the population decline.\n\nScenario 2 (NO side): Less than 95% decrease in population compared to before the catastrophe.\nIn this scenario, although the worldwide biological disaster would cause significant loss of life, it would not lead to a catastrophic collapse of human society. Governments, scientists, and citizens would work together to mitigate the impact of the disaster, and the human population would eventually recover to some extent.\n\nGiven the assumption that there will be at least a 10% reduction in the global population by 2100, I estimate the probability of a more than 95% decrease in population compared to before the catastrophe to be relatively low.\n\nConsidering both scenarios, I estimate the probability of a more than 95% decrease in population compared to before the catastrophe to be around 15%.\n\n[Answer] 0.15"

Economic collapse: A sudden population decline could result in a collapse of the global economy, leading to a further decline in population.\n2. Social and political instability: The catastrophe may lead to widespread social unrest, political instability, and even wars, which could exacerbate the population decline.\n3. Prolonged effects of the catastrophe: Depending on the nature of the catastrophe, its effects could be long-lasting, leading to a sustained decline in the population.\n\nConsidering these factors, one might argue that a population decline exceeding 95% is possible. However, I estimate the probability of this happening to be relatively low.\n\nOn the NO side, several factors could prevent such a drastic population decline:\n1. Human resilience and adaptability: History has shown that humans are capable of overcoming significant challenges and adapting to new circumstances.\n2. Technological advancements: By 2100, it is likely that we will have developed advanced technologies to mitigate the effects of a biological catastrophe, such as advanced medical treatments, improved disaster response, and more efficient resource management.\n3. International cooperation: A global catastrophe could prompt increased international cooperation, leading to a coordinated global response to mitigate the effects of the disaster.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I estimate that the probability of a population decline exceeding 95% relative to the pre-disaster population is relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.15",
                "On the YES side, a global biological catastrophe could cause widespread panic, economic collapse, and disruption of essential services like healthcare, food production, and transportation. These factors could exacerbate the population decline and lead to a downward spiral. Additionally, the catastrophe could trigger secondary disasters, such as nuclear accidents, wars, or social unrest, which would further contribute to the decline. In this scenario, the probability of a population decline exceeding 95% is significant.\n\nOn the NO side, humanity has shown resilience in the face of disasters throughout history. Governments, international organizations, and communities would likely work together to mitigate the effects of the catastrophe and prevent further decline. Advances in technology, medicine, and infrastructure could also help limit the impact of the disaster. Furthermore, the population might adapt to the new conditions, and birth rates could increase in response to the decline, leading to a recovery over time. In this scenario, the probability of a population decline exceeding 95% is relatively low.\n\nConsidering these factors and the uncertainty of such an event, I estimate that the probability of a population decline exceeding 95% relative to the pre-disaster population in the event of a global biological catastrophe causing at least a 10% drop in the world's population by 2100 is around 30%.\n\n[Answer] 0.3",

The global community has shown a commitment to reducing nuclear stockpiles and preventing nuclear proliferation through agreements like the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW).\n3. The concept of mutually assured destruction (MAD) has historically deterred large-scale nuclear conflicts.\n4. Even if an offensive detonation occurs, it might not escalate to a full-blown nuclear conflict, making it less likely that the overall force of nuclear weapons detonated would reach 1000 Mt.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I estimate that the probability of the overall force of nuclear weapons detonated by 2050 going beyond 1000 Mt is relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.1",

Improved intelligence and counter-terrorism efforts: Since 9/11, the US has significantly increased its counter-terrorism efforts, both domestically and internationally.\n2. Enhanced security measures: Airports, public spaces, and critical infrastructure have implemented more stringent security measures to prevent potential attacks.\n3. International cooperation: The US has strengthened its alliances and cooperation with other countries to combat terrorism and share intelligence.\n\nThese factors contribute to a higher probability of preventing a terrorist attack on the scale of 9/11.\n\nOn the NO side, there are still some risks to consider:\n\n1. Evolving threats: Terrorist organizations and lone actors continue to adapt their tactics and methods, making it difficult to predict and prevent every potential attack.\n2. Homegrown terrorism: The rise of domestic terrorism and extremist ideologies may pose a threat that is harder to detect and prevent.\n3. Cyberterrorism: As technology advances, the potential for cyberterrorism increases, which could have devastating consequences on critical infrastructure and human lives.\n\nTaking into account the improvements in counter-terrorism efforts and the remaining risks, I estimate that the probability of preventing a US terrorist attack equal to or worse than 9/11 in terms of lives lost through the year 2030 is around 85%.\n\n[Answer] 0.85",

Additionally, as more nations develop nuclear capabilities, the risk of an inadvertent event might increase. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of an inadvertent nuclear explosion to be low.\n\nOn the ILLICIT side, the risk of a non-test nuclear explosion caused by illicit activities, such as terrorism or unauthorized use, may be higher.

The possibility of nuclear terrorism or a rogue state using nuclear weapons is a significant concern for the international community. However, efforts have been made to prevent the spread of nuclear materials and technology, and to monitor and control the use of nuclear weapons.\n\nConsidering both possibilities, the probability of a non-test nuclear explosion within a state's borders by 2050 would likely lean more towards being the result of an illicit event.

This principle is enshrined in Article 5 of the NATO Treaty.\nIf a NATO country, excluding the US, were to carry out an offensive nuclear explosion, it would likely be in response to a significant threat or attack from a non-NATO country.\nIn such a scenario, the US, as a key NATO member, would be expected to support its ally and potentially retaliate against the aggressor.\nThus, I estimate that the probability of a subsequent offensive detonation by the US within that same conflict is relatively high.\n\nOn the NO side, the US might choose to pursue alternative means of retaliation or de-escalation, considering the potential catastrophic consequences of a nuclear conflict.\nAdditionally, the US could opt for a more measured response, such as conventional military action or diplomatic sanctions, depending on the specific circumstances.\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of a subsequent offensive detonation by the US within that same conflict is not guaranteed.\n\nTaking both sides into account, I estimate that the probability of a subsequent offensive detonation by the US within that same conflict is around 70%.\n\n[Answer] 0.7",

This could lead the US to respond in kind, as a show of support and solidarity with its NATO allies. Additionally, the US has a history of strong military involvement and has a large nuclear arsenal. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of a subsequent offensive detonation by the US is reasonably high in this scenario.\n\nOn the NO side, the US has not used nuclear weapons in conflict since 1945, and the global community generally views the use of nuclear weapons as a last resort due to their devastating consequences. The US may choose to respond with conventional military force instead, or pursue diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict.

                "GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonists are a class of drugs that have shown promise in treating type 2 diabetes and obesity. They work by increasing insulin secretion and reducing appetite, leading to weight loss.\n\nOn the YES side, several GLP-1 receptor agonists are already approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, and some are being investigated for obesity treatment. Notably, Novo Nordisk's semaglutide has recently been approved by the FDA for obesity treatment. This suggests that the development of GLP-1-based drugs is progressing, and there is a possibility that a new small molecule drug could be approved by 2029. Considering the growing obesity epidemic and the need for effective treatments, I estimate the probability of a GLP-1-based small molecule drug for obesity being approved by 2029 is moderately high.\n\nOn the NO side, drug development is a complex process with many uncertainties. The success rate of a drug from preclinical studies to approval is relatively low, and it takes an average of 10-15 years for a new drug to reach the market. Additionally, regulatory agencies such as the FDA and EMA have stringent requirements for drug approval, and there is no guarantee that a new GLP-1-based small molecule drug will meet these requirements. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of a GLP-1-based small molecule drug for obesity not being approved by 2029 is also significant.\n\nTaking both perspectives into account, I estimate the probability of a GLP-1-based small molecule drug for obesity treatment obtaining FDA or EMA approval by 2029 to be around 60%.\n\n[Answer] 0.6",

They work by increasing insulin secretion and reducing glucose levels in the blood.\n\nOn the YES side, several GLP-1 receptor agonists have already been approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, such as liraglutide, exenatide, and semaglutide. These drugs have shown significant weight loss effects in clinical trials, and some, like semaglutide, have already been approved for obesity treatment. The success of these drugs suggests that there is a strong possibility of new GLP-1-based drugs being developed and approved for obesity treatment by 2029. Given the current research and development landscape, I estimate the probability of a GLP-1-based small molecule drug for obesity treatment obtaining FDA or EMA approval by 2029 to be around 70%.\n\nOn the NO side, drug development is a complex and uncertain process, with many potential obstacles and setbacks. Challenges in developing a new GLP-1-based drug for obesity treatment could include safety concerns, efficacy issues, or regulatory hurdles. Additionally, the emergence of new treatment options or a shift in focus towards other therapeutic targets could reduce the likelihood of a GLP-1-based small molecule drug for obesity treatment being approved by 2029. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of a GLP-1-based small molecule drug for obesity treatment not obtaining FDA or EMA approval by 2029 to be around 30%.\n\n[Answer] 0.7",
                "GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonists are a class of drugs that have shown promise in the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. They work by mimicking the effects of the naturally occurring hormone GLP-1, which helps regulate blood sugar levels and appetite.\n\nOn the YES side, several GLP-1-based drugs have already been approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, such as liraglutide, semaglutide, and dulaglutide. Some of these drugs have also demonstrated a significant reduction in body weight in clinical trials. For example, semaglutide has shown promising results in weight loss and has recently been approved by the FDA under the brand name Wegovy for chronic weight management in adults with obesity or overweight.\n\nGiven the existing approvals and ongoing research in the GLP-1 field, it is likely that more GLP-1-based drugs targeting obesity will be developed and submitted for approval in the coming years. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of a GLP-1-based small molecule drug for obesity treatment obtaining FDA or EMA approval by 2029 is high.\n\nOn the NO side, drug development is a complex and uncertain process, with many potential obstacles and setbacks. It is possible that new GLP-1-based drugs might face challenges in clinical trials, regulatory hurdles, or competition from other treatments. Additionally, the long-term safety and efficacy of GLP-1-based drugs for obesity treatment are still being investigated.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I estimate that the probability of a GLP-1-based small molecule drug for obesity treatment obtaining FDA or EMA approval by 2029 is around 75%.\n\n[Answer] 0.75",

They have established semi-autonomous regions in Iraq and Syria, and have developed their own military forces, such as the Peshmerga and the YPG.

Therefore, I estimate the probability of a Kurdish state being admitted as a UN member state by 2030 to be somewhat plausible.\n\nOn the NO side, there are significant geopolitical obstacles to the formation of a Kurdish state. The territories where Kurds live are divided among four countries: Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria.

This suggests that the global electricity production from renewable energy is already close to, or above, the 25% threshold.\n\nOn the NO side, there are still challenges to the widespread adoption of renewable energy, such as intermittency, storage, and the need for grid modernization. Additionally, some countries may continue to rely on fossil fuels due to economic and political factors.\n\nConsidering both sides, it seems more likely that the global electricity production will consist of more than 25% from renewable energy by 2030, given the current trajectory and international efforts to combat climate change.\n\n[Answer] 0.1",
                "On the YES side, the global electricity production from renewable energy sources has been growing rapidly in recent years.\nAccording to the International Energy Agency (IEA), renewables accounted for almost 30% of the global electricity production in 2020.\nThe IEA also predicts that renewables will account for 60% of the growth in global electricity generation through 2025.\nConsidering the current growth rate and the increasing focus on climate change, it is likely that the share of renewables in global electricity production will continue to increase.\n\nOn the NO side, the global demand for electricity is also growing, which could lead to an increase in the use of non-renewable energy sources.\nThere are still challenges to overcome in terms of infrastructure, storage, and grid integration for renewable energy.\nMoreover, the political will and policy support for renewable energy may vary across countries and regions.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I estimate that the probability of global electricity production consisting of 25.00% or a lower percentage from renewable energy by 2030 is low.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",

The United States' GDP is approximately $21 trillion. Musk's net worth is currently equivalent to about 1.2% of the United States' GDP.\n\nOn the YES side, we can consider the possibility of rapid wealth accumulation by individuals through technological breakthroughs, market dominance, and investments. Additionally, the United States' GDP growth may slow down, making it easier for an individual's net worth to reach 2% of the GDP.\n\nOn the NO side, it's important to note that historically, no individual has reached the 2% threshold. Furthermore, government regulations, market competition, and income redistribution policies could prevent any single person from amassing such a significant percentage of the GDP. Lastly, the United States' GDP is expected to grow over the next decade, making it more challenging for an individual's net worth to reach 2% of the GDP.\n\nConsidering the historical context and potential future developments, I estimate that the probability of the richest person in the world in 2033 having a net worth equivalent to or greater than 2% of the United States' GDP at the time is relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",
                "To answer this question, let's consider a few factors:\n\n1. Historical context: Currently, the richest person in the world, Elon Musk, has a net worth of around $250 billion. The United States' GDP in 2020 was approximately $21.43 trillion. Elon Musk's net worth represents about 1.17% of the US GDP.\n\n2. Future growth of US GDP: Assuming a conservative average annual growth rate of 2% for the US GDP, by 2033, the GDP would be around $29.65 trillion.\n\n3. 2% of the US GDP in 2033: 2% of the projected $29.65 trillion GDP would be around $593 billion.\n\n4. Wealth growth of the richest person: For the richest person to have a net worth equivalent to or greater than 2% of the US GDP in 2033, their net worth would need to grow to at least $593 billion. This would require a growth rate of around 6.6% per year for the current richest person, Elon Musk, or for someone else to surpass him with such growth.\n\nOn the YES side, the wealth of the richest people has been growing rapidly, and technological breakthroughs could lead to even higher growth rates.\n\nOn the NO side, it's important to consider that wealth concentration might not continue at the same pace, and regulatory measures could limit the wealth accumulation of the richest individuals.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I estimate that the probability of the richest person in the world in 2033 having a net worth equivalent to or greater than 2% of the United States' GDP at the time is relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.25",
                "To answer this question, we first need to analyze the historical trends in the net worth of the richest person and the GDP of the United States.\n\nOn the YES side, the net worth of the richest person has been increasing over the years.\nFor example, Jeff Bezos, the current richest person, has a net worth of around $200 billion.\nMeanwhile, the United States' GDP is currently around $21 trillion.\nIf we assume that the US GDP grows at an average rate of 2% per year, by 2033, it would be approximately $28.6 trillion.\n2% of the United States' GDP in 2033 would be around $572 billion.\n\nOn the NO side, historically, the net worth of the richest person has never reached 2% of the United States' GDP.\nFor example, Jeff Bezos' current net worth of $200 billion is only about 0.95% of the current US GDP.\nEven considering rapid increases in wealth, it would be quite challenging for the richest person's net worth to reach 2% of the United States' GDP by 2033.\n\nTaking both perspectives into account, I estimate that the probability of the richest person in the world in 2033 having a net worth equivalent to or greater than 2% of the United States' GDP at the time is relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.1",

If this growth continues, it is possible that the richest person's net worth could reach 2% of the United States' GDP in 2033.\n\nOn the other hand, the United States' GDP has been growing steadily, and it is projected to continue growing in the coming years. In 2021, the US GDP was around $21 trillion. Assuming a conservative annual growth rate of 2%, the US GDP in 2033 would be approximately $29 trillion.

Assuming a conservative 2% annual growth rate over the next 13 years, the US GDP in 2033 would be approximately $28.1 trillion.\n\n2. Current wealth of the richest person: As of August 2021, the richest person in the world is Elon Musk, with a net worth of around $254 billion. To match or exceed 2% of the US GDP in 2033, the richest person would need to have a net worth of at least $562 billion (2% of $28.1 trillion).\n\n3. Wealth growth of the richest person: Assuming the richest person's wealth grows at a 7% annual rate, their net worth would be approximately $684 billion in 2033. This estimate exceeds 2% of the projected US GDP in 2033.\n\nHowever, several factors could impact this prediction:\n\n- Wealth concentration trends: Wealth concentration has been increasing, which could lead to an even higher net worth for the richest person in 2033.\n- Market volatility: Economic crises, market fluctuations, and other unforeseen events could impact the growth of both the US GDP and the richest person's net worth.\n- Changes in tax policies: Governments could introduce wealth taxes or other measures that could impact the net worth of the richest person.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I estimate that the probability of the richest person's net worth matching or exceeding 2% of the US GDP in 2033 is around 65%.\n\n[Answer] 0.65",

His eldest daughter, Princess Catharina-Amalia, is the heir apparent. If Willem-Alexander is succeeded by Catharina-Amalia, the Netherlands will have a Queen regnant.\n\nNorway: King Harald V is the reigning monarch. His son, Crown Prince Haakon, is the heir apparent. Assuming Haakon becomes King, the likelihood of Norway having a Queen regnant during the same time as the other countries decreases.\n\nSpain: King Felipe VI is the current monarch. His daughter, Princess Leonor, is the heir apparent. If Felipe is succeeded by Leonor, Spain will have a Queen regnant.\n\nSweden: King Carl XVI Gustaf is the reigning monarch. His daughter, Crown Princess Victoria, is the heir apparent. If Carl is succeeded by Victoria, Sweden will have a Queen regnant.\n\nConsidering the current line of succession, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, and Sweden are likely to have Queens regnant in the future. However, Norway's line of succession presents a challenge for all five countries to concurrently have Queens regnant. Additionally, unforeseen events and changes to succession laws could impact this prediction.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I estimate that the probability of all five countries concurrently having Queens regnant prior to 2100 is relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",

                "On the YES side, Saudi Arabia has been gradually opening up to Israel in recent years, with increasing unofficial contacts and cooperation. This is mainly driven by their shared concerns about Iran's regional influence and potential nuclear capabilities. The Abraham Accords, which saw the normalization of relations between Israel and several Arab states, could also pave the way for Saudi Arabia to follow suit. Additionally, Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 economic plan aims to diversify its economy and reduce its dependence on oil, which might lead to increased cooperation with Israel in various sectors.

Regional dynamics: A non-nuclear Iran might reduce the immediate threat perception for Saudi Arabia, making it more open to cooperation with Israel on regional security and economic issues.\n2. The Abraham Accords: The normalization of relations between Israel and several Arab states in recent years, such as the UAE and Bahrain, might encourage Saudi Arabia to follow suit.\n3. US influence: The United States has been a key player in brokering peace deals between Israel and Arab states, and it might continue to push for normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel.\n\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of Saudi Arabia establishing normalized relations with Israel if Iran fails to obtain a nuclear bomb by 2031 is moderately high.\n\nOn the NO side, there are factors that might prevent Saudi Arabia from normalizing relations with Israel:\n\n1. Domestic politics: The Saudi government might face backlash from conservative elements within the country if it were to establish normalized relations with Israel.\n2. Palestinian issue: Saudi Arabia has traditionally supported the Palestinian cause, and normalization with Israel might be perceived as a betrayal of that stance.\n3. Regional rivalries: Even if Iran does not obtain a nuclear bomb by 2031, Saudi Arabia might still perceive it as a significant threat, potentially hindering normalization with Israel.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I estimate that the probability of Saudi Arabia establishing normalized relations with Israel if Iran fails to obtain a nuclear bomb by 2031 is around 60%.\n\n[Answer] 0.6",

It is guided by the principles of effective altruism, which prioritize evidence-based, high-impact, and cost-effective interventions.\n\nOn the YES side, the OPP has demonstrated a strong commitment to these principles in its grantmaking so far. As of 2021, it has directed substantial funding to causes like global catastrophic risks, farm animal welfare, and criminal justice reform, all of which align with the principles mentioned. If the OPP continues to follow its current trajectory, it is likely that in 2031 it will still be directing at least 90% of its grants according to these principles.\n\nOn the NO side, there are a few factors that could lead to a lower percentage of grants being directed according to these principles by 2031. One possibility is that the OPP may decide to diversify its grantmaking portfolio, investing in a broader range of causes that may not strictly adhere to the principles. Additionally, unforeseen global events or changes in the philanthropic landscape could influence the OPP's priorities and grantmaking strategy.\n\nTaking both perspectives into account, I estimate that the probability of at least 90% of Open Philanthropy Project grants being directed according to these principles in 2031 is moderately high.\n\n[Answer] 0.75",

Advances in biotechnology and aging research are accelerating, and there is growing interest in the development of therapies targeting age-related diseases. Given the rapid pace of scientific progress and the potential for breakthroughs in the next decade, it is possible that a senolytic therapy could receive FDA approval before 2030.\n\nOn the NO side, the development of new pharmaceutical products is a complex and time-consuming process, with many potential obstacles. It typically takes 10-15 years for a new drug to progress from discovery to market, and the success rate for clinical development is relatively low. Moreover, the field of senolytics is still in its early stages, and many questions remain about the safety and efficacy of these therapies. There is also the possibility of regulatory hurdles, as the FDA may require more extensive data and longer-term studies before granting approval for a senolytic therapy.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I estimate the probability of the US FDA granting authorization for a commercially available senolytic therapy or pharmaceutical product before January 1, 2030, to be around 60%.\n\n[Answer] 0.6"

The island's politics are more focused on the status debate (statehood, independence, or maintaining the current territorial status) than on party lines.\nAdditionally, the Republican Party may make efforts to appeal to Puerto Rican voters, which could lead to a more competitive political landscape.\n\nConsidering these factors, I estimate that the probability of both initial Senators representing the Democratic Party is around 70%.\n\n[Answer] 0.7",

In recent non-binding referendums, Puerto Ricans have voted for Democratic candidates by a significant margin. Additionally, the current political climate in Puerto Rico leans more towards the Democratic Party, with several high-profile politicians affiliated with the party.\n\nConsidering these factors, I estimate that the probability of both initial Senators representing the Democratic Party is relatively high, at around 70%.\n\nOn the NO side, Puerto Rico's local politics are complex and don't entirely align with the U.S. two-party system. The main parties in Puerto Rico are the New Progressive Party (PNP) and the Popular Democratic Party (PPD), which have different stances on statehood and other local issues. It's possible that the local political dynamics could lead to a split representation in the Senate, with one Senator from each party.\n\nTaking this into account, I estimate that the probability of both initial Senators representing the Democratic Party is slightly lower, at around 60%.\n\n[Answer] 0.6",

Additionally, the island's population tends to support progressive policies, which align more closely with the Democratic Party. Given this, there is a high probability that both Senators would be Democrats if Puerto Rico achieves statehood by 2035.\n\nOn the NO side, it is important to consider that Puerto Rico's local politics are not strictly aligned with the U.S. two-party system. The island has its own political parties, such as the New Progressive Party (PNP) and the Popular Democratic Party (PPD), which do not directly correspond to the U.S. Democratic and Republican parties.

Public opinion on marijuana legalization has been shifting in recent years, with increasing support for recreational use.\n2. Some traditionally conservative states have already legalized medical marijuana, indicating a potential shift in attitudes.\n3. Economic factors, such as tax revenue generated from marijuana sales, might push more states towards legalization.\nConsidering these factors, I estimate the probability of a supermajority of these states legalizing recreational marijuana before 2041 to be moderately high.\n\nOn the NO side:\n1. Strongly Republican states often have more conservative views on drug policy, which could slow down the legalization process.\n2. Some states might be more inclined to focus on medical marijuana legalization rather than recreational use.\n3. External factors, such as changes in federal policy or public opinion, could impact the timeline for legalization.\nTaking these factors into account, I estimate the probability of a supermajority of these states legalizing recreational marijuana before 2041 to be moderately low.\n\nBalancing both sides, I estimate the probability of a supermajority of these strongly Republican states legalizing recreational marijuana before 2041 to be around 60%.\n\n[Answer] 0.6",

Some regions and industries might continue to rely on coal for various reasons, such as economic factors, job preservation, or energy security concerns. Considering these factors, it is possible that coal could remain above 1% in Germany's electricity generation mix by 2039. I estimate the probability of this scenario to be moderate.\n\nOn the NO side, Germany has committed to phasing out coal by 2038 as part of its Energiewende (energy transition) policy.

However, some exceptions might be made, and there may be a delay in the implementation of the law.\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of the proportion of Germany's net public electricity generated by both hard and brown coal staying above 1% in 2039 is low.\n\nOn the NO side, Germany has been actively increasing its share of renewable energy sources in its energy mix, with a target of 65% renewable electricity by 2030.\nGermany's coal exit law aims to phase out coal-fired power plants by 2038, which means that by 2039, the proportion of electricity generated by coal should be minimal or non-existent.\nAdditionally, public opinion and political pressure are likely to continue pushing for a faster transition away from coal.\nHence, I estimate that the probability of the proportion of Germany's net public electricity generated by both hard and brown coal staying above 1% in 2039 is very low.\n\n[Answer] 0.1",
