                "The detonation of more than 100 nuclear weapons by 2050 would have catastrophic consequences for global food security, as it would cause a nuclear winter, which would lead to a significant drop in global temperatures, reduced sunlight, and disrupted rainfall patterns. This would have a severe impact on crop yields, and it is likely that average global cereal yields would be significantly lower in the following years.\n\nHowever, the probability of more than 100 nuclear detonations occurring by 2050 is extremely low, as it would require a major global conflict involving multiple nuclear-armed nations.

Therefore, I estimate the probability of at least one fatality resulting from an offensive nuclear detonation in Russia by 2030, if there's an offensive detonation anywhere by then, to be around 80%.\n\n[Answer] 0.8",
                "It is difficult to estimate the probability of such a catastrophic event, but I will try to provide some insights.\n\nOn the YES side, Russia has the largest nuclear arsenal in the world, and tensions between Russia and other countries, such as the United States, have been high in recent years.\nMoreover, there is always a risk of accidents or miscalculations that could lead to a nuclear detonation.\nHowever, it is worth noting that the use of nuclear weapons is widely regarded as a last resort, and the consequences of such an action would be devastating for all parties involved.\n\nOn the NO side, the use of nuclear weapons is highly unlikely due to the catastrophic consequences that would follow.\nAdditionally, Russia is a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and has committed to reducing its nuclear arsenal.\nFurthermore, there have been no offensive nuclear detonations since the end of World War II.\n\nTaking into account the above factors, I estimate that the probability of at least one fatality from an offensive nuclear detonation in Russia by 2030, if there's an offensive detonation anywhere by then, is very low.\n\n[Answer] 0.05"

However, it is difficult to predict whether this trend will continue or level off in the future.\n\nAssuming that the interest in Effective Altruism will continue to grow at a similar rate as it has in the past, it is possible that the total interest in 2030 will be at least 0.2 times the total interest in 2017.\n\nHowever, there are many factors that could affect the growth of interest in Effective Altruism, such as changes in the global political and economic landscape, the emergence of new social movements, and the availability of information and resources.\n\nTaking all of these factors into account, I estimate that the probability of the total interest in Effective Altruism on Google Trends in 2030 being at least 0.2 times the total interest in 2017 is around 70%.\n\n[Answer] 0.7"

For example, some satellites are equipped with propulsion systems that allow them to maneuver and avoid collisions, and there are proposals for technologies that could remove space debris from orbit. Additionally, the International Space Station and other manned spacecraft are equipped with shielding to protect against small debris.\n\nTaking into account both views, I estimate that the probability of losing at least 10% of our operational satellites due to collisions with space junk by 2050 is relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.2"

It is possible that genetic engineering and screening may become more widely accepted and integrated into society, making the need for legal protections unnecessary. Additionally, there may be concerns about the enforceability and practicality of such a law.\n\nGiven the uncertainty surrounding this issue, I estimate that the probability of an anti-discrimination law being enacted to protect U.S. federal employees who have been genetically-edited or screened as embryos by 2100 is very low.\n\n[Answer] 0.1",

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) already prohibits discrimination based on genetic information, and some states have enacted additional protections. As genetic technology advances and becomes more widespread, it is possible that federal employment law will be updated to include specific protections for genetically-edited or screened individuals.\n\nOn the NO side, there may be resistance to enacting such a law due to concerns about the potential for abuse of genetic technology and the difficulty of enforcing such protections.

However, I can provide some analysis to help inform an estimate.\n\nOn the YES side, North Korea has been actively developing its nuclear capabilities and has conducted several nuclear tests in recent years. The country has also made threats against other nations, including the United States, and has engaged in provocative behavior. If North Korea were to use a nuclear weapon offensively, it is possible that there could be at least one fatality.\n\nOn the NO side, the use of nuclear weapons is widely regarded as a last resort, and the international community has taken steps to discourage their use. Additionally, the consequences of a nuclear attack would be severe, and North Korea's leaders are likely aware of this. It is also possible that North Korea's nuclear program could be disrupted or dismantled before it is able to produce a functional weapon.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I estimate that the probability of at least one fatality from an offensive nuclear detonation in North Korea by 2050, if there's an offensive detonation anywhere, is around 20%.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",

Additionally, the international community has been working to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and promote disarmament.\n\nTaking into account these factors, I estimate that the probability of there being at least one fatality from an offensive nuclear detonation in Pakistan by 2030, if there's an offensive detonation anywhere by then, is low.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",
                "It is difficult to estimate the probability of such a specific event, but I will try to provide an answer based on available information.\n\nOn the YES side, Pakistan is a nuclear-armed country with a history of political instability and terrorist attacks. There is a risk that a terrorist group could obtain a nuclear weapon or that a conflict with India could escalate to a nuclear exchange. In such a scenario, it is possible that there could be at least one fatality from an offensive nuclear detonation.\n\nOn the NO side, the use of nuclear weapons is widely regarded as a last resort due to the catastrophic consequences. Pakistan has also stated that it maintains a \"credible minimum deterrence\" posture and that its nuclear weapons are solely for defensive purposes. Additionally, there have been efforts to improve nuclear security and prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n\nTaking into account the risks and efforts to prevent nuclear catastrophes, I estimate that the probability of at least one fatality from an offensive nuclear detonation in Pakistan by 2030, if there's an offensive detonation anywhere by then, is very low.\n\nTherefore, my estimate is around 0.1%.\n\n[Answer] 0.001"

Additionally, there is no guarantee that Harvard will continue to be a top-performing investor over the next century.\n\nTaking into account the above factors, I estimate that the probability of the Harvard Endowment having more assets under management on June 30, 2119 than it did on June 30, 2019, on an inflation-adjusted basis, is around 70%.\n\n[Answer] 0.7",
                "Predicting the value of an endowment fund over a century is a challenging task, and there are many factors that could influence the outcome. However, we can consider some factors that might affect the value of the Harvard Endowment over the next century.\n\nOn the YES side, Harvard has a long history of successful investing, and its endowment has grown significantly over the past few decades. The endowment has also weathered economic downturns and financial crises in the past, suggesting that it is well-managed and diversified. Additionally, inflation is likely to continue over the next century, which could increase the nominal value of the endowment.\n\nOn the NO side, there are some concerns about the future of higher education and the financial sustainability of universities. The rise of online education and other disruptive technologies could reduce the demand for traditional higher education, which could in turn reduce the value of university endowments. Additionally, there is some evidence that the returns on endowment funds have been declining in recent years, which could make it more difficult for Harvard to achieve significant growth in the future.\n\nTaking into account these factors, I estimate that the probability of the Harvard Endowment having more assets under management on June 30, 2119 than it did on June 30, 2019, on an inflation-adjusted basis, is around 70%.\n\n[Answer] 0.7"

Additionally, there may be policy interventions aimed at increasing college attendance, such as increased financial aid or free college programs.\n\nHowever, a 50% decline in college attendance among college-aged U.S. citizens by 2040 seems unlikely given the current trends and projections. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of this event occurring is very low.\n\n[Answer] 0.1",
                "On the YES side, there are several factors that could lead to a decline in college attendance among college-aged U.S. citizens. These include rising tuition costs, student debt, and the availability of alternative education and training options such as online courses, vocational training, and apprenticeships. Additionally, demographic trends such as declining birth rates and an aging population could lead to a smaller pool of college-aged individuals.\n\nOn the NO side, there are also factors that could mitigate or even reverse the decline in college attendance. For example, there may be increased demand for higher education as the job market becomes more competitive and specialized. Additionally, government policies and initiatives could be implemented to make college more affordable and accessible.\n\nOverall, a 50% decline in college attendance among college-aged U.S. citizens by 2040 seems unlikely. While there are certainly challenges facing the higher education system in the United States, there are also many efforts underway to address these challenges and ensure that college remains a viable option for students. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of this event occurring is very low.\n\n[Answer] 0.1"

However, assuming such a catastrophe occurs, it is unlikely that the global population would decline by more than 95% relative to the pre-catastrophe population.\n\nOn the YES side, a nuclear catastrophe could have devastating effects on the global population, leading to widespread death and destruction. The long-term effects of radiation exposure could also lead to a decline in fertility rates and an increase in birth defects, further reducing the global population.\n\nOn the NO side, it is unlikely that a nuclear catastrophe would result in the complete extinction of the human race.

It is difficult to imagine a scenario in which such a catastrophic event would occur and yet leave enough survivors to maintain a population of even 5% of the pre-catastrophe population.\n\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of the global population declining more than 95% relative to the pre-catastrophe population is very low.\n\n[Answer] 0.05"

Additionally, public health measures such as social distancing and mask-wearing have been effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19 and could be applied to other infectious diseases.\n\nTaking into account these factors, I estimate that the probability of there being more than 50M deaths worldwide in a single 1-year period due to an influenza strain of natural origin by 2035 is very low.\n\n[Answer] 0.1"

However, predicting the exact outcome of such an event is difficult, as it would depend on various factors such as the nature of the AI failure, the response of governments and societies, and the availability of resources to mitigate the impact.\n\nOn the YES side, a catastrophic AI failure could potentially lead to a global collapse of infrastructure, food systems, and social order, resulting in a significant reduction in the global population. A reduction of more than 95% is possible if the event is severe enough and if there is no effective response to mitigate its impact.\n\nOn the NO side, it is also possible that the impact of the AI failure could be limited through effective response measures, such as the development of robust AI safety protocols, international cooperation, and investment in resilience measures. Additionally, the global population is projected to stabilize and even decline in the coming decades due to factors such as declining fertility rates and aging populations.\n\nGiven the uncertainty and complexity of the scenario, I estimate that the probability of the global population declining by more than 95% relative to the pre-catastrophe population is very low.\n\n[Answer] 0.1",

                "The accelerating expansion of the universe is a well-established scientific fact, supported by multiple lines of evidence, including observations of Type Ia supernovae, cosmic microwave background radiation, and large-scale structure of the universe.\n\nOn the YES side, the accelerating universe is a widely accepted scientific consensus among cosmologists, and it is unlikely that this consensus will change significantly in the next decade.\nMoreover, the ongoing and upcoming cosmological surveys, such as the Dark Energy Survey, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, and the Euclid mission, are expected to provide even more precise measurements of the accelerating expansion of the universe, further strengthening the consensus.\n\nOn the NO side, it is possible that new evidence or alternative theories may emerge that challenge the current consensus, but this is considered unlikely given the robustness of the existing evidence.\n\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of the majority of leading cosmologists in 2030 agreeing that the evidence points to an accelerating universe is very high.\n\n[Answer] 0.95",
                "On the YES side, the current evidence from various cosmological observations, such as Type Ia supernovae, cosmic microwave background radiation, and baryon acoustic oscillations, all point towards an accelerating universe.\nThis is also supported by the standard model of cosmology, which includes dark energy as the driving force behind the acceleration.\nTherefore, it is likely that the majority of leading cosmologists in 2030 will still agree that the evidence points to an accelerating universe.\n\nOn the NO side, there could be new observations or alternative theories that challenge the current understanding of the universe's acceleration.\nFor example, some modified gravity theories propose that the acceleration is not due to dark energy but rather a modification of the laws of gravity on cosmological scales.\nIf such theories gain more support and evidence, it could lead to a shift in the consensus among cosmologists.\nHowever, this is currently a minority view and not widely accepted.\n\nHence, I estimate that the probability of the majority of leading cosmologists in 2030 agreeing that the evidence points to an accelerating universe is very high.\n\n[Answer] 0.8",

Moreover, the development of new technologies, such as hypersonic missiles or space-based weapons, could create new risks and uncertainties.\n\nOn the NO side, both Russia and the US have a strong interest in avoiding a nuclear exchange, as it would have catastrophic consequences for both countries and the world as a whole. Both countries have also shown a willingness to engage in arms control negotiations in the past, and there is a growing awareness of the need to address the risks of nuclear war.\n\nTherefore, conditional on New START being renewed or replaced by another similar treaty after February 2026, I estimate that the probability of a nuclear exchange between Russia and the US by 2035 is low.\n\n[Answer] 0.1",

However, we can consider some factors that may influence the likelihood of armed conflict between Taiwan and China.\n\nOn the YES side, tensions between Taiwan and China have been increasing in recent years, with China increasing its military presence in the region and Taiwan seeking closer ties with the United States. China has also refused to rule out the use of force to reunify with Taiwan, and has conducted military exercises near the island. In addition, Taiwan has been increasing its military spending and has been conducting military exercises of its own.\n\nOn the NO side, both sides have shown a willingness to engage in dialogue and negotiations, and there have been no major military clashes between Taiwan and China in recent years.

However, based on our understanding of life on Earth, it is possible that if we find life on an icy moon of the gas giants, we may also find evidence of macrofauna.\n\nOn the YES side, if we find microbial life on an icy moon, it is possible that it could be sustained by a larger ecosystem, including macrofauna. Additionally, the presence of macrofauna could be an indicator of a more complex and diverse ecosystem.\n\nOn the NO side, it is also possible that the conditions on an icy moon may not be conducive to the development of macrofauna, even if microbial life is present. Additionally, it is possible that any macrofauna present may be difficult to detect or may not leave behind clear evidence of their existence.\n\nGiven the uncertainty surrounding the existence and nature of life beyond Earth, it is difficult to provide a precise estimate.

However, if we do discover life on one of these moons by 2200, it is difficult to predict whether we will also find evidence of macrofauna.\n\nOn the YES side, if we discover microbial life on an icy moon, it is possible that there could be larger, more complex organisms living in the same environment. For example, on Earth, microbial life exists in a wide range of environments, from deep-sea hydrothermal vents to the frozen tundra of the Arctic. In some cases, these environments also support larger organisms, such as tube worms or polar bears.\n\nOn the NO side, it is also possible that any life we discover on an icy moon will be limited to microbial organisms. The extreme conditions on these moons, including low temperatures and high radiation levels, may make it difficult for larger organisms to survive.

For example, the increasing commercialization of space travel and the potential for space-based resources could lead to more public interest and concern about space-related issues.
