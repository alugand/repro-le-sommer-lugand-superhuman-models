Additionally, the ISS is expected to reach the end of its operational life by the mid-2020s, which could create a demand for a new space station. Therefore, the probability of a new international space station being launched by 2035, given that the number of satellites orbiting Earth exceeds 10,000, is not negligible.\n\nOn the NO side, launching a space station is a complex and expensive undertaking that requires significant resources and international cooperation. The development and launch of a new space station could face technical, financial, and political challenges, which could delay or prevent its launch.

Additionally, the globalization of music and the ease of access to new and diverse sounds through streaming services could lead to the emergence of new genres.\n\nOn the NO side, the music industry is highly competitive and dominated by a few major players. It can be difficult for new genres to gain traction and achieve significant market share. Furthermore, the music industry has become increasingly consolidated in recent years, with major labels and streaming services controlling a large portion of the market.\n\nConsidering these factors, I estimate that the probability of a new musical genre emerging and achieving at least 10% of global music streaming market share between now and 2045 is relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",

Several short films have already been created by AI, and some have been showcased at film festivals.\nAs AI technology continues to advance, it is possible that an AI-directed movie could be created that is of high enough quality to be considered for a Best Picture Oscar nomination.\n\nOn the NO side, the film industry is heavily influenced by human creativity and artistic expression. While AI can assist in certain aspects of filmmaking, it is still unclear if it can replicate the nuanced decisions that a human director makes throughout the filmmaking process.\nAdditionally, the Academy Awards are notoriously conservative and slow to adapt to new technologies and trends.\n\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of a movie directed by an AI being nominated for a Best Picture Oscar between now and 2045 is relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",

If the industry continues to grow at a similar pace, it is possible that it could exceed $60 billion in a single year by 2045.\n\nOn the NO side, the movie industry is facing increasing competition from streaming services and other forms of entertainment, which could limit its growth potential. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the movie industry, with many theaters closing and production schedules disrupted. It is unclear how long it will take for the industry to fully recover from these disruptions.\n\nGiven the uncertainty surrounding both the AI-directed movie nomination and the global movie industry revenue, I estimate that the probability of the global revenue of the movie industry exceeding $60 billion in a single year between now and 2045 conditional on an AI-directed movie being nominated for a Best Picture Oscar during the same period is around 50%.\n\n[Answer] 0.5",

With the increasing popularity of streaming services and the potential for new markets in developing countries, it is possible that the revenue could exceed $60 billion in a single year by 2045. Moreover, the use of AI in movie production could lead to cost savings and more efficient processes, which could contribute to higher revenues.\n\nOn the NO side, the movie industry has been facing challenges such as piracy, changing consumer preferences, and competition from other forms of entertainment. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the industry, with many theaters closed and productions delayed.

The growth rate of the movie industry is expected to continue, driven by factors such as technological advancements and emerging markets.\n\nOn the YES side, AI technology has been advancing rapidly in recent years. There have already been AI-generated movie scripts and music compositions. As AI technology continues to improve, it is possible that an AI-directed movie could be produced that is of high enough quality to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar.\n\nOn the NO side, the movie industry is heavily influenced by human creativity and emotion, which may be difficult for AI to replicate.

                "This is a difficult question to answer definitively, as it depends on a lot of factors that are difficult to predict. However, there are a few arguments that can be made on both sides:\n\nOn the YES side, there are a few reasons why a major city could experience a population decline of more than 10% between 2023 and 2050. One reason is that some cities may become less attractive to live in due to factors such as rising crime rates, lack of affordable housing, or environmental degradation. Another reason is that technological advances may enable people to work remotely more easily, reducing the need to live in urban centers. Finally, demographic shifts such as aging populations or declining birth rates could also contribute to population declines in some cities.\n\nOn the NO side, there are also some reasons why a major city might not experience a population decline of more than 10% between 2023 and 2050. For example, some cities may continue to attract people due to factors such as job opportunities, cultural amenities, or good transportation infrastructure. Additionally, some cities may be able to adapt to changing circumstances by investing in new industries or infrastructure, or by implementing policies to address issues such as housing affordability or environmental sustainability.\n\nTaking all of these factors into account, I estimate that the probability of a major city experiencing a population decline of more than 10% between 2023 and 2050 is relatively low, around 20%.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",

Additionally, there is a risk that antibiotic resistance may continue to increase despite efforts to combat it, making the discovery of new antibiotics less effective.\n\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of a new antibiotic being discovered between 2023 and 2030, conditional on a significant decrease in antibiotic resistance, is around 60%.\n\n[Answer] 0.6",
                "On the YES side, the decreasing trend of antibiotic resistance could incentivize pharmaceutical companies to invest more in antibiotic research and development.\nFurthermore, there are several promising antibiotic candidates in the pipeline, some of which have shown efficacy against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\nAccording to a report by the World Health Organization, there are currently 43 antibiotics in clinical development, with some expected to be available in the next few years.\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of a new antibiotic being discovered between 2023 and 2030, conditional on a significant decrease in antibiotic resistance, is moderately high.\n\nOn the NO side, discovering a new antibiotic is a complex and time-consuming process that involves significant financial and scientific resources.\nMoreover, the development of new antibiotics has been hindered by regulatory challenges, low profitability, and scientific obstacles.\nEven if antibiotic resistance decreases, it is not guaranteed that a new antibiotic will be discovered within the given timeframe.\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of a new antibiotic being discovered between 2023 and 2030, conditional on a significant decrease in antibiotic resistance, is moderately low.\n\nConsidering both sides, I estimate that the probability of a new antibiotic being discovered between 2023 and 2030, conditional on a significant decrease in antibiotic resistance, is around 50%.\n\n[Answer] 0.5",
                "On the YES side, there are several reasons to believe that a new antibiotic may be discovered between 2023 and 2030. For example, there are ongoing efforts to develop new antibiotics, and some promising candidates are currently in clinical trials. Additionally, the incentive to develop new antibiotics may increase if antibiotic resistance decreases, as there would be a larger market for new drugs.\n\nOn the NO side, discovering a new antibiotic is a difficult and time-consuming process, and there is no guarantee that any of the current candidates will be successful. Additionally, it is possible that other treatments for bacterial infections, such as phage therapy or immunotherapy, may become more prominent and reduce the demand for new antibiotics.\n\nTherefore, assuming a significant decrease in antibiotic resistance between 2023 and 2030, I estimate that the probability of a new antibiotic being discovered during the same period is around 70%.\n\n[Answer] 0.7",
                "On the YES side, the discovery of new antibiotics has been a priority for many years, and there are ongoing efforts to develop new drugs.\nIn addition, the decrease in antibiotic resistance could be a result of better stewardship and reduced use of antibiotics, which would create a more favorable environment for the discovery of new antibiotics.\nAccording to some experts, there are promising candidates in the pipeline, and some of them could be approved for use in the next few years.\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of a new antibiotic being discovered between 2023 and 2030, conditional on a significant decrease in antibiotic resistance, is moderate to high.\n\nOn the NO side, the discovery of new antibiotics is a complex and challenging process that requires significant investments and resources.\nMoreover, the decrease in antibiotic resistance might not be significant enough to create a favorable environment for the discovery of new antibiotics.\nAdditionally, there are regulatory and economic challenges associated with the development and approval of new antibiotics.\nHence, I estimate that the probability of a new antibiotic being discovered between 2023 and 2030, conditional on a significant decrease in antibiotic resistance, is moderate.\n\nTaking into account both views, I estimate that the probability of a new antibiotic being discovered between 2023 and 2030, conditional on a significant decrease in antibiotic resistance, is around 60%.\n\n[Answer] 0.6"

This could be due to the increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate financial asset, the potential benefits of using blockchain technology for financial transactions, and the increasing global economic uncertainty.\n\nOn the NO side, there are several challenges to adopting Bitcoin as an official currency, including regulatory issues, volatility, and scalability. Additionally, many countries might prefer to create their own digital currencies rather than adopting an existing cryptocurrency.\n\nGiven the conditional statement, we can assume that the price of Bitcoin will exceed $100,000 at some point before the end of 2028. Therefore, based on current trends and the potential benefits and challenges, I estimate that the probability of a major country adopting Bitcoin as its official currency by the end of 2028 is around 20%.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",
                "On the YES side, El Salvador recently adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, and other countries like Paraguay and Panama have expressed interest in following suit.\nAdditionally, if Bitcoin reaches a price of $100,000, it would likely attract more attention and legitimacy from governments and institutions.\n\nOn the NO side, adopting Bitcoin as an official currency would require significant regulatory and infrastructure changes, and many countries may be hesitant to make such a drastic move.\nFurthermore, the volatility and lack of stability in the price of Bitcoin may deter countries from adopting it as their official currency.\n\nGiven these factors, I estimate the probability of a major country adopting Bitcoin as its official currency by the end of 2028, conditional on Bitcoin exceeding $100,000 at any point before then, to be around 20%.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",
                "On the YES side, El Salvador recently became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, which could encourage other countries to follow suit.\nSeveral other countries, such as Ukraine, are also considering adopting Bitcoin as a legal tender.\nIf Bitcoin's price exceeds $100,000, it could incentivize more countries to adopt it as an official currency to reap the benefits of a decentralized and digital currency.\n\nOn the NO side, adoption of Bitcoin as an official currency could be hindered by regulatory and legal challenges.\nMoreover, the volatility of Bitcoin's price could discourage countries from adopting it as an official currency.\n\nGiven the uncertainty around the adoption of Bitcoin as an official currency, and the conditional probability on Bitcoin's price exceeding $100,000, I estimate the probability of a major country adopting Bitcoin as its official currency by the end of 2028 to be around 20%.\n\n[Answer] 0.2"

Additionally, Bitcoin has a limited supply, which could further increase its value if demand increases.\n\nOn the NO side, there are several challenges for Bitcoin to become an official currency of a major country. Firstly, Bitcoin's price is highly volatile, which could make it difficult to use as a stable currency for transactions. Secondly, governments may be hesitant to adopt a decentralized currency that is not under their control. Thirdly, there are concerns around the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining, which could discourage adoption.\n\nHowever, if a major country does adopt Bitcoin as its official currency, I estimate that the probability of the price of Bitcoin exceeding $100,000 at any point before the end of 2028 is high, given the increased adoption and usage of Bitcoin.\n\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of the price of Bitcoin exceeding $100,000 at any point before the end of 2028 conditional on a major country adopting Bitcoin as its official currency by the end of 2028 is around 80%.\n\n[Answer] 0.8",

                "C) team win the Ballon d'Or award before 2030?\n\nOn the YES side, it is possible that an AFC player could win the Ballon d'Or award before 2030, as there are a few talented players from the AFC region who have the potential to achieve this feat. For example, Son Heung-min from South Korea, who plays for Tottenham Hotspur in the English Premier League, has been performing consistently at a high level and has been gaining recognition from football fans worldwide.\n\nOn the NO side, historically, the Ballon d'Or award has been dominated by players from Europe and South America, with only one player from the AFC region (Hidetoshi Nakata from Japan) ever being nominated for the award. Additionally, the level of competition and exposure for AFC players may not be as high as those playing in Europe or South America.\n\nTaking into account the historical dominance of European and South American players in the Ballon d'Or award, along with the potential for talented AFC players to emerge in the future, I estimate that the probability of an AFC player winning the Ballon d'Or award before 2030 is low.\n\n[Answer] 0.1",
                "On the YES side, several players from AFC countries have played in top European leagues, such as Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, etc. For example, Park Ji-sung from South Korea, Shinji Kagawa from Japan, Son Heung-min from South Korea, and many others. This indicates that AFC players have the potential to play for top-level clubs.\n\nOn the NO side, the competition to secure a spot in top-level clubs is very high, and there are many talented players from all over the world. Moreover, the requirements for obtaining work permits and visas can be a significant barrier for players from outside the European Union.\n\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of a player from an AFC country playing for a top-level club in Europe is around 10%.\n\n[Answer] 0.1",
                "On the YES side, there have been several players from AFC nations who have played for European football clubs in the past, such as Park Ji-sung, Son Heung-min, and Ali Daei, among others.\nMoreover, the globalisation of football has made it easier for players from different regions to showcase their talents and attract the attention of scouts and clubs from other continents.\nTherefore, it is likely that a player playing for an AFC nation will play for a European football club in the future.\n\nOn the NO side, the vast majority of players from AFC nations play in their domestic leagues or in other Asian leagues, and only a small percentage make it to Europe.\nMoreover, there are several challenges that players from AFC nations face when trying to play for European football clubs, such as language barriers, cultural differences, and visa issues.\nTherefore, it is possible that a player playing for an AFC nation may never play for a European football club.\n\nTaking into account both views, I estimate that the probability of a player playing for an AFC nation playing for a European football club in the future is around 30%.\n\n[Answer] 0.3",
                "On the YES side, there have been several instances of players from AFC countries playing for European clubs, which indicates that there is a certain level of talent in AFC countries.\nAdditionally, there are several AFC countries that have made it to the FIFA World Cup in the past, which further suggests that there is a pool of talented players in the region.\n\nOn the NO side, the top football leagues in Europe, such as the English Premier League and Spanish La Liga, are highly competitive and attract the best players from around the world. It is possible that the level of competition in AFC countries is not as high as in Europe, which could limit the development of top-tier players.\n\nOverall, I estimate that the probability of a player playing for an AFC country making it to a top European football club is relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",
                "[Q] Will a player playing for an Asian Football Confederation (AFC) team win the Ballon d'Or before 2030?\n\nOn the YES side, there have been several Asian players who have been nominated for the Ballon d'Or in the past, such as Hidetoshi Nakata, Shinji Kagawa, and Son Heung-min.\nThe AFC has been investing heavily in football development, and there are several promising young players emerging from countries like Japan, South Korea, and Iran.\nMoreover, the Ballon d'Or criteria have been changing in recent years, with more emphasis being placed on team performance and less on individual statistics, which could benefit players from less high-profile leagues.\n\nOn the NO side, the Ballon d'Or has historically been dominated by players from Europe and South America, with only one winner from outside these regions (George Weah from Liberia).\nThe AFC has not yet produced a player who has won the award, and it may take several years for a player to emerge who can compete with the likes of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.\nMoreover, the current pandemic situation may have a negative impact on the development of young players.\n\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of a player playing for an AFC team winning the Ballon d'Or before 2030 is low.\n\n[Answer] 0.1",
                "C) team win the Ballon d'Or within the next 5 years?\n\nOn the YES side, Asian football has been improving in recent years, with several players from AFC teams playing for top European clubs.\nIn 2018, Luka Modric broke the 10-year Messi-Ronaldo duopoly to win the Ballon d'Or, indicating that there is a chance for other players to win the award.\nMoreover, the Ballon d'Or criteria have been changed to consider individual and collective performances, which could benefit players from AFC teams who perform well in international competitions.\n\nOn the NO side, the Ballon d'Or has been dominated by players from European clubs, with only one winner from outside Europe or South America in its history.\nMoreover, the level of competition in AFC leagues is generally considered lower than that in Europe, which could limit the chances of AFC players winning the award.\n\nConsidering these factors, I estimate that the probability of a player playing for an AFC team winning the Ballon d'Or within the next 5 years is very low.\n\n[Answer] 0.05"

This would likely require a coordinated international effort, which could increase the likelihood of a new international climate agreement being signed.\n\nOn the YES side, there is already momentum towards international cooperation on climate change, with the Paris Agreement being signed by 196 countries in 2015. Additionally, many countries have already committed to ambitious emissions reduction targets, which could encourage others to follow suit. Moreover, the urgency of the climate crisis could create political pressure for countries to take action.\n\nOn the NO side, international climate negotiations have historically been challenging, with countries often prioritizing their own economic interests over global climate action. Additionally, some countries may be hesitant to commit to emissions reduction targets that could impact their economic growth.\n\nTaking into account all these factors, I estimate that the probability of a new international climate agreement being signed by at least 100 countries by 2035, conditional on limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, is around 70%.\n\n[Answer] 0.7",
                "Limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2035 requires rapid and substantial emissions reductions by all countries.\nOn the YES side, there is growing international momentum for climate action, with many countries pledging to reach net-zero emissions by mid-century or earlier.\nThe Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius, has been ratified by 189 countries.\nThere is also increasing pressure from civil society and the private sector for more ambitious climate action.\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of a new international climate agreement being signed by at least 100 countries by 2035, conditional on limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, is high.\n\nOn the NO side, there are still some countries that are resistant to climate action, and some may be unwilling to sign a new agreement.\nAdditionally, achieving the necessary emissions reductions to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius will require significant political will and cooperation among countries, which may be difficult to achieve.\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of a new international climate agreement being signed by at least 100 countries by 2035, conditional on limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, is around 70%.\n\n[Answer] 0.7",
                "Limiting global average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2035 would require significant and immediate action by countries around the world. \n\nOn the YES side, signing a new international climate agreement would be a critical step towards achieving this goal. The Paris Agreement, which was signed by 195 countries, is a good example of international cooperation on climate change. Furthermore, many countries have already committed to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, which suggests a willingness to work together towards a common goal.\n\nOn the NO side, reaching an agreement that satisfies the needs and interests of at least 100 countries may prove difficult. Countries have different priorities, resources, and challenges, and may be hesitant to make significant commitments without assurances that others will do the same. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has put a strain on international cooperation and resources, which may make it harder to reach an agreement.\n\nGiven these factors, I estimate that the probability of a new international climate agreement being signed by at least 100 countries by 2035, conditional on limiting global average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, is around 60%.\n\n[Answer] 0.6"

While eSports has been growing rapidly, it is difficult to predict how quickly it will continue to grow and how popular football-based games will be compared to other eSports games. However, given the popularity of football globally and the potential for eSports to continue to grow, it is reasonable to estimate that there is a 50% chance that a football-based eSports game will become one of the top 5 most-watched eSports globally by 2040.\n\nSecond, on the likelihood of an eSports athlete winning a major traditional sports award during the same period. This is a highly unlikely event, as traditional sports awards are typically reserved for athletes who compete in physical sports. However, as eSports continues to grow and gain recognition, it is possible that some traditional sports awards may expand to include eSports athletes. Given the current state of traditional sports awards and the slow pace of change in the sports industry, I estimate that there is only a 10% chance of an eSports athlete winning a major traditional sports award during the same period.\n\nCombining these two estimates, the probability of an eSports athlete winning a major traditional sports award conditional on a football-based eSports game becoming one of the top 5 most-watched eSports globally by 2040 is:\n\n[Answer] 0.05",
                "The probability of a football-based eSports game becoming one of the top 5 most-watched eSports globally by 2040 is uncertain, but it is not impossible given the growing popularity of eSports and the global appeal of football.\n\nAssuming that a football-based eSports game does become one of the top 5 most-watched eSports globally by 2040, the probability of an eSports athlete winning a major traditional sports award during the same period is still uncertain.\n\nOn the YES side, eSports are becoming more recognized as legitimate sports, and some traditional sports awards have already recognized eSports achievements. For example, in 2019, the International Olympic Committee recognized eSports as a sport, and The Game Awards introduced an eSports player of the year award. Additionally, if eSports continue to grow in popularity, it is possible that traditional sports organizations may incorporate eSports into their awards categories.\n\nOn the NO side, traditional sports awards are typically reserved for athletes who compete in physical sports, and it may be difficult for eSports athletes to compete against traditional athletes in terms of physical abilities. Additionally, traditional sports organizations may be hesitant to recognize eSports achievements as equivalent to physical sports achievements.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I estimate that the probability of an eSports athlete winning a major traditional sports award during the same period, conditional on a football-based eSports game becoming one of the top 5 most-watched eSports globally by 2040, is around 30%.\n\n[Answer] 0.3"

                "On the YES side, football is the most popular sport globally, and there is a huge fan base that could potentially be interested in watching football-based eSports games.\nMoreover, the eSports industry has been growing rapidly in recent years, with more and more people tuning in to watch eSports events.\nIf an eSports athlete were to win a major traditional sports award, it would likely bring more attention and legitimacy to the eSports industry, potentially leading to more viewership of football-based eSports games.\n\nOn the NO side, there are already many popular eSports games that have established themselves as the top-watched games globally, such as League of Legends, Dota 2, and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.\nIt may be difficult for a football-based eSports game to break into the top 5, given the competition from these already established games.\nFurthermore, the popularity of football as a traditional sport does not necessarily translate to popularity in the eSports world, where different types of games have their own dedicated fan bases.\n\nOverall, I estimate that the probability of a football-based eSports game becoming one of the top 5 most-watched eSports globally by 2040, conditional on an eSports athlete winning a major traditional sports award, is around 30%.\n\n[Answer] 0.3",
                "On the YES side, the popularity of football as a sport is undeniable, with millions of fans worldwide. If a football-based eSports game is well-designed and marketed, it could attract a significant audience, especially among football fans.\n\nOn the NO side, there are already many popular eSports games, such as League of Legends, Fortnite, and Dota 2, that have established themselves as the top games in the industry. It may be challenging for a new game to break into the top 5, especially given the competition and the existing fan bases for those games.\n\nAssuming that an eSports athlete winning a major traditional sports award by 2040 is a rare event, the probability of a football-based eSports game becoming one of the top 5 most-watched eSports globally during the same period is relatively low.\n\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of a football-based eSports game becoming one of the top 5 most-watched eSports globally conditional on an eSports athlete winning a major traditional sports award by 2040 is around 20%.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",
                "This is a difficult question to answer with certainty, as it involves predicting two separate events, each with its own set of uncertainties. However, we can consider some factors that might influence the outcome.\n\nOn the YES side, football (soccer) is the most popular sport in the world, with a massive global fanbase. If a football-based eSports game were to capture even a fraction of that audience, it could become one of the most-watched eSports globally. Additionally, the growth of eSports has been rapid in recent years, with some estimates projecting the industry to reach $1 billion in revenue by 2025. This growth could lead to increased interest in all types of eSports, including football-based games.\n\nOn the NO side, there are many other popular eSports games, such as League of Legends and Fortnite, that have established themselves as top contenders in the industry. It may be difficult for a new game, even one based on a popular sport like football, to break into the top 5. Additionally, winning a major traditional sports award is a significant accomplishment, and it's possible that no eSports athlete will achieve this feat by 2040.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I estimate that the probability of a football-based eSports game becoming one of the top 5 most-watched eSports globally by 2040, conditional on an eSports athlete winning a major traditional sports award, is around 30%.\n\n[Answer] 0.3",

                "This is a difficult question to answer as it involves multiple conditional events. However, I will try to break it down into smaller parts and estimate the probabilities accordingly.\n\nFirstly, the probability of an eSports athlete winning a major traditional sports award by 2040 is quite low as traditional sports awards are typically dominated by athletes from traditional sports. However, as eSports gain more recognition and acceptance, this probability might increase in the future. For the sake of this estimation, let's assume a probability of 0.1.\n\nSecondly, if an eSports athlete wins a major traditional sports award, it is likely to boost the popularity and legitimacy of eSports as a competitive sport. Therefore, the probability of a football-based eSports game becoming one of the top 5 most-watched eSports globally might increase. However, this also depends on the growth and popularity of other eSports games. For the sake of this estimation, let's assume a probability of 0.5.\n\nMultiplying these probabilities, we get:\n\n0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05\n\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of a football-based eSports game becoming one of the top 5 most-watched eSports globally, conditional on an eSports athlete winning a major traditional sports award by 2040, is around 5%.\n\n[Answer] 0.05"
