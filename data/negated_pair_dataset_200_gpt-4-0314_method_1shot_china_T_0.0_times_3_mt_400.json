Additionally, the United States' GDP could grow at a faster rate than the net worth of the richest person, making it less likely for their net worth to exceed 2% of the GDP.\n\nOn the NO side, the net worth of the richest person has been growing rapidly in recent years, and this trend could continue. Technological advancements and new industries could create opportunities for wealth accumulation that we cannot currently predict. Furthermore, wealth concentration has been increasing, which could lead to a higher net worth for the richest person relative to the United States' GDP.\n\nTaking both sides into account, I estimate that the probability of the richest person in the world in 2033 having a net worth less than 2% of the United States' GDP at the time is around 70%.\n\n[Answer] 0.7"

                "On the YES side, the idea of a Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI) has gained traction in recent years, with several European countries experimenting with or discussing the concept. For example, Finland conducted a basic income experiment in 2017-2018, and Spain introduced a minimum income scheme in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has also increased discussions around social safety nets and income support. Additionally, the European Parliament has called for a framework directive on minimum income in the EU. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of a GMI being introduced in any EU country before 2041 is relatively high.\n\nOn the NO side, there are still many political, economic, and social challenges to implementing a GMI. Some countries may be hesitant to adopt such a policy due to concerns about the cost, potential disincentives to work, or opposition from certain political factions. Furthermore, the EU is a diverse group of countries with varying levels of economic development and social welfare systems, which could make it difficult to reach a consensus on a GMI policy.\n\nTaking both sides into account, I estimate that the probability of a Guaranteed Minimum Income being introduced in any EU country before 2041 is around 70%.\n\n[Answer] 0.7",

                "On the YES side, more than 100 nuclear detonations by 2050 would have significant environmental and climatic consequences.\nNuclear winter, caused by the release of large amounts of soot and dust into the atmosphere, could lead to a decrease in global temperatures and reduced sunlight.\nThis would negatively impact agricultural production, including cereal yields.\nAdditionally, radioactive fallout could contaminate soil and water, further affecting crop growth.\nConsidering these factors, I estimate that the probability of average global cereal yields being at least 5% lower in the following 5 years is high.\n\nOn the NO side, advances in agricultural technology and crop breeding could potentially offset some of the negative impacts of nuclear detonations.\nFor example, genetically modified crops might be more resistant to radiation and lower light conditions.\nHowever, the scale of the potential catastrophe makes it difficult to rely on these factors to fully mitigate the impact on cereal yields.\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of average global cereal yields not being at least 5% lower in the following 5 years is relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.15"

Currently, BB(1), BB(2), BB(3), and BB(4) are known, but BB(5) remains unknown.\n\nOn the YES side, the growth rate of Busy Beaver numbers is faster than any computable function, making it difficult to determine BB(5) using conventional methods.\nAdditionally, the halting problem, which is undecidable, is closely related to Busy Beaver numbers, further complicating the determination of BB(5).\nGiven the current state of knowledge and the complexity of the problem, I estimate that the probability of BB(5) not being known by 2040 is relatively high.\n\nOn the NO side, advancements in computational methods, algorithms, and hardware could potentially lead to the discovery of BB(5) before 2040.\nMoreover, breakthroughs in theoretical computer science or related fields might provide new insights into the problem.\n\nTaking both sides into account, I estimate that the probability of BB(5) not being known by 2040 is around 70%.\n\n[Answer] 0.7"

Therefore, I estimate that the probability of China not launching a full-scale invasion of Taiwan before 2030 is relatively high.\n\nOn the NO side, tensions between China and Taiwan have been increasing in recent years, with China conducting military exercises near Taiwan and increasing its military presence in the region. China's leadership has also been more assertive in its claims over Taiwan, and there is a risk that a miscalculation or escalation could lead to a full-scale invasion. Furthermore, China's military capabilities have been growing, which could make an invasion more feasible in the future. Hence, I estimate that the probability of China not launching a full-scale invasion of Taiwan before 2030 is somewhat lower.\n\nTaking both sides into account, I estimate that the probability of China not launching a full-scale invasion of Taiwan before 2030 is around 75%.\n\n[Answer] 0.75",

Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of a Forward Party member not holding any seat in the US congress or the presidency by February 1st, 2029, is relatively high.\n\nOn the NO side, the Forward Party could potentially gain momentum over the next few years, especially if it can capitalize on growing dissatisfaction with the two major parties. If the party can successfully build a strong grassroots movement and attract high-profile candidates, it may have a chance of winning seats in Congress or even the presidency. However, this scenario seems less likely given the historical dominance of the two-party system.\n\nTaking both sides into account, I estimate that the probability of a Forward Party member not holding any seat in the US congress or the presidency by February 1st, 2029, is around 85%.\n\n[Answer] 0.85",

These countries are major global powers and could be targeted in a conflict involving nuclear weapons. Additionally, they are part of NATO, which could lead to involvement in a conflict where a nuclear weapon is used. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of at least one fatality in these countries is relatively high if there is an offensive nuclear detonation.\n\nOn the NO side, the use of nuclear weapons is heavily stigmatized, and the global community has made significant efforts to prevent their use. The likelihood of an offensive nuclear detonation occurring anywhere by 2030 is relatively low. Furthermore, even if a nuclear weapon is used, it may not necessarily target or affect the US, UK, or France. Defensive measures, such as missile defense systems, could also mitigate the impact of a nuclear attack.

The number of nuclear weapons has significantly decreased since the Cold War, and many countries are committed to reducing their arsenals further. Additionally, the use of nuclear weapons is widely considered a last resort due to the catastrophic consequences and the potential for mutually assured destruction. The development of precision-guided conventional weapons also reduces the need for large-scale nuclear strikes. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of the total yield of nuclear weapons offensively detonated by 2050 not exceeding 1000Mt is high, given that any offensive detonation occurs.\n\nOn the NO side, geopolitical tensions and conflicts could escalate, leading to the use of nuclear weapons. The proliferation of nuclear weapons to more countries could increase the risk of their use. Additionally, the development of new, more powerful nuclear weapons could lead to higher yields in a conflict.

Although not all signatories have ratified the treaty, it has created a strong norm against nuclear testing. Furthermore, the international community has been working to reduce nuclear arsenals and promote disarmament. The last nuclear test with a yield above 30 MT was conducted by the Soviet Union in 1961, and since then, no country has tested a weapon with such a high yield.\n\nConsidering the strong international norm against nuclear testing and the efforts towards disarmament, I estimate that the probability of any state testing a nuclear weapon with a yield above 30 MT by 2030 is relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.1"

The Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC) loop is a transportation system built by TBC, which consists of 1.7 miles of tunnels and three stations.\n\nOn the YES side, TBC has several projects in the pipeline, including the Las Vegas Loop, which aims to connect the entire Las Vegas Strip, the airport, and downtown. This project is expected to be larger than the LVCC loop. Additionally, TBC has proposed other projects, such as the Chicago Express Loop and the Dugout Loop in Los Angeles.

NATO plays a significant role in European defense, and some countries may be reluctant to duplicate or undermine NATO's efforts.\n3.

                "The Alcubierre drive is a theoretical concept for faster-than-light (FTL) travel, which involves warping spacetime to create a \"bubble\" that moves faster than the speed of light.\n\nOn the YES side, there have been some theoretical advancements in the understanding of the Alcubierre drive concept. Additionally, the rapid development of technology and scientific understanding could potentially lead to breakthroughs in FTL travel. However, these advancements are still far from a functional prototype. Therefore, I estimate the probability of a functional Alcubierre drive-like FTL device being demonstrated before 2100 to be low.\n\nOn the NO side, there are several significant challenges and limitations to the Alcubierre drive concept. These include the requirement of exotic matter with negative energy density, the potential for causality violations (time travel paradoxes), and the enormous energy requirements. Additionally, the concept is purely theoretical and has not been tested experimentally. Given these challenges and the current state of scientific understanding, I estimate the probability of a functional Alcubierre drive-like FTL device being demonstrated before 2100 to be very low.\n\nTaking both sides into account, I estimate the probability of a functional Alcubierre drive-like FTL device being demonstrated before 2100 to be around 5%.\n\n[Answer] 0.05",
                "The Alcubierre drive is a theoretical faster-than-light (FTL) propulsion concept based on a speculative solution to the equations of general relativity. It proposes a way to travel faster than light by contracting space in front of a spacecraft and expanding it behind.\n\nOn the YES side, there have been some theoretical developments in the field of warp drives and FTL travel. Some researchers have proposed modifications to the original Alcubierre drive concept that could potentially reduce the energy requirements. Technological advancements in the next 80 years could potentially lead to breakthroughs in our understanding of physics and engineering that might make FTL travel possible. Therefore, I estimate a low probability for a functional Alcubierre drive-like FTL device being demonstrated before 2100.\n\nOn the NO side, there are several significant challenges and limitations to the Alcubierre drive concept. First, it requires exotic matter with negative energy density, which has not been observed in nature. Second, the energy requirements for the drive are immense, equivalent to the mass-energy of a planet like Jupiter. Third, there are potential causality issues and other theoretical problems associated with FTL travel, such as time travel paradoxes. Given these challenges and our current understanding of physics, it seems unlikely that a functional Alcubierre drive-like FTL device will be demonstrated before 2100.
