Examples include the accidental release of a deadly pathogen or the intentional use of bioweapons. The rapid advancement of biotechnology and the increasing accessibility of these tools could increase the likelihood of such an event. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of a global catastrophe being principally due to biotechnologies or bioengineered organisms is moderate.\n\nOn the NO side, there are other significant risks to consider, such as climate change, nuclear war, and artificial intelligence. Climate change poses a long-term threat to global stability and could lead to resource scarcity, mass migration, and conflict. Nuclear war remains a possibility, with the potential to cause widespread devastation.

                "On the YES side, some elements, such as helium, are considered to be under serious threat due to their finite supply and increasing demand.\nHelium, for example, is used in various industries, including medical imaging, electronics, and space exploration.\nIf the current rate of consumption continues, some experts predict that helium reserves could be depleted within the next few decades.\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of at least one element being essentially used up by humanity by 2040 is relatively high.\n\nOn the NO side, new technologies and recycling methods are being developed to reduce the consumption of scarce elements.\nFor example, researchers are working on alternative methods for cooling MRI machines that do not rely on helium.\nAdditionally, the discovery of new reserves and more efficient extraction methods could extend the availability of these elements.\nGovernments and industries are also becoming more aware of the need to conserve scarce resources, which could lead to more sustainable practices.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I estimate that the probability of at least one element being essentially used up by humanity by 2040 is around 40%.\n\n[Answer] 0.4"

They have been linked to adverse health effects, and there is growing concern about their presence in drinking water.\n\nOn the YES side, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been working on addressing PFAS contamination in drinking water. In February 2020, the EPA released its PFAS Action Plan, which includes steps to evaluate and potentially regulate PFAS in drinking water. The EPA has also initiated the process to designate PFAS as hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). These actions indicate that the EPA is taking PFAS contamination seriously and may implement a Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) regulation for all US municipal water systems. Considering the growing concern and the EPA's actions, I estimate the probability of implementing a PFAS MCL regulation before January 1, 2030, to be moderately high.\n\nOn the NO side, the process of implementing a new MCL regulation can be lengthy and complex, involving scientific research, risk assessments, and public input.

                "The Hubble constant (H0) tension refers to the discrepancy between the measurements of the expansion rate of the universe obtained from different methods. The Lambda-CDM model is the current standard model of cosmology, which includes dark energy (Lambda) and cold dark matter (CDM).\n\nOn the YES side, there are several possible explanations for the H0 tension that do not require replacing the Lambda-CDM model:\n1. Systematic errors in measurements: Improved techniques and new data might resolve the discrepancy.\n2. Local effects: The discrepancy might be due to local variations in the expansion rate, which could be reconciled with the Lambda-CDM model.\n3. Minor modifications to the Lambda-CDM model: Adjustments to the model's parameters or assumptions might resolve the tension without replacing the entire model.\nConsidering these possibilities, I estimate the probability of resolving the H0 tension without replacing the Lambda-CDM model by 01-Jan-2030 to be moderately high.\n\nOn the NO side, the H0 tension might be an indication of new physics beyond the Lambda-CDM model. If this is the case, a new cosmological model would be required to resolve the tension. The development of such a model might take longer than the given timeframe or might not be possible at all.\nTaking this into account, I estimate the probability of not resolving the H0 tension without replacing the Lambda-CDM model by 01-Jan-2030 to be moderately low.\n\n[Answer] 0.7"

Furthermore, even if a nuclear detonation occurs, it might not be in a location that would directly impact China or its citizens. Taking these factors into account, I estimate the probability of China not witnessing any fatalities due to an offensive nuclear detonation by 2030 to be higher.\n\nGiven the low likelihood of an offensive nuclear detonation happening anywhere by 2030 and the possibility that it might not directly impact China, I estimate the probability of China witnessing at least one fatality due to the explosion to be around 15%.\n\n[Answer] 0.15",

Tensions in the region could potentially escalate to a nuclear conflict.\nAdditionally, China's rapid economic and military growth might lead to increased geopolitical tensions, raising the risk of a nuclear incident.\nConsidering these factors, I estimate that the probability of China witnessing at least one fatality due to an offensive nuclear detonation by 2030 is non-negligible.\n\nOn the NO side, the use of nuclear weapons is widely considered a last resort due to the catastrophic consequences and the principle of mutually assured destruction.\nDiplomatic efforts and international agreements, such as the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, aim to prevent the use of nuclear weapons.\nMoreover, the global community has not seen a nuclear weapon used offensively since 1945, indicating a strong aversion to their use.\nTaking these factors into account, I estimate that the probability of China witnessing at least one fatality due to an offensive nuclear detonation by 2030 is relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.1",

                "On the YES side, the discovery of life on a frosty moon of gas giants would be a significant breakthrough in astrobiology. If we find life in such an environment, it could suggest that life is more adaptable and widespread than previously thought. This could increase the likelihood of finding macrofauna, or larger, multicellular organisms, in these environments. Additionally, if the discovered life forms are complex and diverse, it could indicate a higher probability of macrofauna existing in these ecosystems. Therefore, I estimate the probability of finding indications of macrofauna upon locating life on a frosty moon of gas giants by 2200 to be moderately high.\n\nOn the NO side, the harsh conditions on frosty moons of gas giants, such as extreme cold, high radiation, and lack of sunlight, could limit the development of complex life forms like macrofauna. It is also possible that life on these moons could be limited to simple, single-celled organisms or microbial communities, which would not be considered macrofauna. Additionally, our ability to detect and study life on these moons by 2200 may still be limited, making it difficult to find conclusive evidence of macrofauna. Therefore, I estimate the probability of finding indications of macrofauna upon locating life on a frosty moon of gas giants by 2200 to be moderately low.\n\nTaking both views into account, I estimate the probability of finding indications of macrofauna upon locating life on a frosty moon of gas giants by 2200 to be around 40%.\n\n[Answer] 0.4"

                "On the YES side, a significant reduction in the human population to below 400 million by 2100 could lead to various challenges, such as:\n1. Loss of knowledge and skills, which could hinder technological advancements and make it difficult to maintain existing infrastructure.\n2. Reduced genetic diversity, which could make the human population more susceptible to diseases and other threats.\n3. Potential for social unrest and conflict due to resource scarcity and other factors.\n\nConsidering these factors, I estimate the probability of human extinction within the subsequent 20-year period to be relatively low.\n\nOn the NO side, there are several reasons why a reduced population might not lead to extinction:\n1. A smaller population could be more sustainable, reducing the strain on resources and the environment.\n2. Technological advancements could help mitigate the challenges posed by a reduced population, such as through automation and improved healthcare.\n3. Human adaptability and resilience have historically allowed us to overcome various challenges and threats.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I estimate the probability of human extinction within the subsequent 20-year period to be very low.\n\n[Answer] 0.05",
                "Assuming the human population reduces to below 400 million by 2100, there are several factors to consider when estimating the probability of extinction within the subsequent 20-year period.\n\nOn the YES side, a rapid decline in population could be due to catastrophic events such as pandemics, nuclear war, or ecological collapse. These events could have long-lasting effects that continue to threaten human survival beyond 2100. Additionally, a smaller population might be more vulnerable to other existential risks, such as asteroid impacts or supervolcanic eruptions. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of extinction within the subsequent 20-year period to be moderate.\n\nOn the NO side, a reduced population could also be the result of deliberate efforts to control population growth, such as through family planning policies or a shift in societal values. In this scenario, the remaining population might be more resilient and better equipped to handle global challenges. Furthermore, technological advancements and international cooperation could help mitigate existential risks. Taking these factors into account, I estimate the probability of extinction within the subsequent 20-year period to be low.\n\nBalancing these considerations, I estimate that the probability of human extinction within the subsequent 20-year period, assuming the population reduces to below 400 million by 2100, is around 15%.\n\n[Answer] 0.15"

Assuming this growth rate continues, the US GDP in 2033 would be approximately $30 trillion. Two percent of this GDP would be $600 billion.

However, the PNP's main goal is statehood for Puerto Rico, and its members have a wide range of political views.

Additionally, geopolitical conflicts and cyber warfare could escalate into a larger conflict. However, the probability of a direct nuclear conflict remains low due to the concept of mutually assured destruction (MAD), which has historically deterred nuclear powers from engaging in direct conflict.\n\nOn the NO side, the extension or replacement of the New START treaty would indicate a willingness from both countries to maintain arms control and reduce the risk of nuclear conflict. Furthermore, diplomatic efforts and communication channels between Russia and the US could help prevent misunderstandings and de-escalate tensions.

Additionally, he has not expressed any interest in running for political office.\n\nOn the NO side, considering his lack of political experience, controversial views, and no indication of interest in running for office, it is highly unlikely that Alex Jones would hold any of the mentioned titles before January 1, 2030.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I estimate that the probability of Alex Jones legally holding one of the mentioned titles before January 1, 2030, is very low.\n\n[Answer] 0.01"
