                "On the YES side, a nuclear detonation, if it occurs, is likely to cause significant damage and casualties.\nIsrael is a small country with a high population density in urban areas, which increases the likelihood of fatalities if a nuclear detonation were to occur.\nIsrael is also situated in a geopolitically tense region, which could increase the risk of such an event.\nTaking these factors into account, I estimate that the probability of at least 1 fatality in Israel from a nuclear detonation by 2030, if any detonation occurs, is very high.\n\nOn the NO side, Israel is known to have a sophisticated missile defense system, which could potentially intercept and neutralize a nuclear threat before it reaches its target.\nAdditionally, the global community is generally opposed to the use of nuclear weapons, and diplomatic efforts could help prevent such an event from occurring.\nConsidering these factors, I estimate that the probability of at least 1 fatality in Israel from a nuclear detonation by 2030, if any detonation occurs, is somewhat lower.\n\nTaking both sides into account, I estimate the probability of at least 1 fatality in Israel from a nuclear detonation by 2030, if any detonation occurs, to be around 85%.\n\n[Answer] 0.85",
                "On the YES side, a nuclear detonation in Israel would likely cause massive damage and loss of life due to the destructive power of nuclear weapons. Israel is a small and densely populated country, which would amplify the impact of a nuclear detonation. Additionally, Israel has a history of conflict with its neighbors, which could increase the risk of a nuclear attack. Therefore, if a nuclear detonation were to occur in Israel by 2030, the probability of at least one fatality would be very high.\n\nOn the NO side, Israel has one of the most advanced missile defense systems in the world, the Iron Dome, which could potentially intercept and neutralize an incoming nuclear missile. Additionally, the international community has a strong interest in preventing the use of nuclear weapons, and diplomatic efforts could help to mitigate the risk of a nuclear attack on Israel.\n\nTaking both views into account, if a nuclear detonation were to occur in Israel by 2030, I estimate that the probability of at least one fatality would be around 95%.\n\n[Answer] 0.95",

The ISS is scheduled to be decommissioned around 2030, and there are no concrete plans for a direct successor. Additionally, space travel remains expensive and risky, and establishing a permanent human presence off Earth by 2050 is a significant challenge.\nHence, I estimate that the probability of the off-Earth human population being less than 13 by the end of 2050 is relatively high.\n\nOn the NO side, there are ambitious plans from private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin for space tourism, lunar bases, and Mars colonization. SpaceX's Starship, for example, aims to carry up to 100 passengers per trip to Mars. If these plans come to fruition, the number of humans off Earth could be much higher than 13 by 2050. However, these plans are subject to significant technical, financial, and regulatory challenges.\nConsidering the ambitious plans and potential breakthroughs in technology, I estimate that the probability of the off-Earth human population being less than 13 by the end of 2050 is lower.\n\nTaking both sides into account, I estimate the probability of the off-Earth human population being less than 13 at midnight UTC time of December 31, 2050, is around 70%.\n\n[Answer] 0.7",

These events can cause geomagnetic disturbances on Earth, potentially damaging power grids, satellites, and other technological systems.\n\nOn the YES side, solar storms are natural phenomena that occur periodically. The Sun follows an approximately 11-year cycle of solar activity, with periods of increased solar storms during solar maximums. Given that there will be around 3-4 solar maximums before 2050, it is likely that some solar storms will occur.\n\nHowever, the term \"massive\" is subjective, and it is important to consider the probability of an extremely large solar storm, similar to the 1859 Carrington Event.\n\nOn the NO side, massive solar storms like the Carrington Event are relatively rare. Some estimates suggest that the probability of a Carrington-like event occurring in the next decade is around 12%.

By 2050, there will be about three solar cycles. The probability of a massive solar storm occurring in any given solar cycle is difficult to predict accurately, but historical data suggests that significant solar storms happen roughly once every 100 years.

Considering this, it is possible that a massive solar storm could occur before 2050.\n\nOn the NO side, while solar storms are relatively frequent, massive solar storms like the Carrington Event are rare. Predicting the occurrence of such events is challenging due to the complex and dynamic nature of the Sun.

If Iran acquires a nuclear bomb, it could potentially change the regional balance of power and heighten tensions. In such a scenario, Saudi Arabia might see the benefits of normalizing relations with Israel to counter Iran's influence and enhance regional security cooperation. Additionally, the Abraham Accords have already set a precedent for Arab nations normalizing relations with Israel. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of Saudi Arabia normalizing relations with Israel by 2031 if Iran gets a nuclear bomb is relatively high.\n\nOn the NO side, Saudi Arabia's domestic politics, religious considerations, and public opinion might hinder normalization efforts. The country has a long history of supporting the Palestinian cause, and normalizing relations with Israel could face significant internal opposition.

The Palestinian issue: Saudi Arabia has traditionally supported the Palestinian cause, and normalizing relations with Israel without a resolution to the conflict might not be well-received domestically or regionally.\n2.

Considering these factors, the probability of at least one fatality in the US, UK, or France from an offensive nuclear detonation is non-negligible.\n\nOn the NO side, several factors could reduce the likelihood of fatalities in these countries. First, the nuclear deterrence mechanisms have been effective in preventing nuclear conflict since the end of World War II. Second, the global community has been working to reduce nuclear arsenals and promote disarmament. Third, the US, UK, and France have advanced missile defense systems that could potentially intercept incoming nuclear missiles. Finally, the potential consequences of a nuclear conflict are so devastating that world leaders are likely to avoid such a scenario.\n\nConsidering both sides, I estimate the probability of at least one fatality from an offensive nuclear detonation in the US, UK, or France by 2030, if there's an offensive detonation anywhere by then, to be relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.1"

The US, UK, and France have advanced missile defense systems that could intercept incoming missiles.\n2. The three countries have strong intelligence agencies that may be able to detect and prevent a nuclear attack.\n3. The global community is working towards nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, which could reduce the risk of nuclear conflict.\n\nOn the NO side, a few factors can increase the probability of fatalities in the event of an offensive nuclear detonation:\n1. The risk of nuclear terrorism or an accidental launch could lead to fatalities.\n2. The growing tensions among nuclear-armed countries and regional conflicts might increase the risk of a nuclear exchange.\n3. The possibility of a successful surprise attack or an overwhelming nuclear strike.\n\nConsidering these factors, I estimate that the probability of no fatalities from an offensive nuclear detonation in the US, UK, or France by 2030, if there's an offensive detonation anywhere by then, is around 70%.\n\n[Answer] 0.7",

                "On the YES side, there is a growing interest and adoption of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, in various sectors of the economy. Some U.S. states like Ohio have already allowed businesses to pay taxes in Bitcoin for a limited time. This suggests that there is some willingness among lawmakers to consider cryptocurrencies as a form of tax payment. As cryptocurrencies become more mainstream, it is possible that more U.S. states or even the federal government could allow tax payments in Bitcoin.\n\nOn the NO side, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies face regulatory challenges and concerns about their volatility, security, and potential for illicit activities. It is possible that the U.S. government might not be willing to accept Bitcoin for tax payments due to these concerns. Additionally, Bitcoin's price volatility could pose challenges for determining accurate tax payments.\n\nConsidering both sides, I estimate that the probability of it being legal to pay taxes in Bitcoin in the U.S. before 2030 is moderate.\n\n[Answer] 0.4",

The detonation could be a low-yield weapon, resulting in fewer casualties.\nConsidering these factors, I estimate the probability of no fatalities in Pakistan from an offensive nuclear detonation by 2030 to be moderate.\n\nOn the NO side, there are reasons why there might be fatalities in Pakistan from an offensive nuclear detonation by 2030:\n1. Pakistan is a nuclear-armed country and has ongoing tensions with its nuclear-armed neighbor, India. This increases the risk of a nuclear conflict in the region.\n2. A nuclear detonation could result in significant casualties, even with advanced warning systems and evacuation plans.\n3. The impact of a nuclear detonation is highly unpredictable, and it is difficult to accurately estimate the number of casualties.\nConsidering these factors, I estimate the probability of fatalities in Pakistan from an offensive nuclear detonation by 2030 to be higher.\n\nTaking both sides into account, I estimate that the probability of no fatalities in Pakistan from an offensive nuclear detonation by 2030 is around 30%.\n\n[Answer] 0.3"

If this trend continues, the US GDP in 2033 will be significantly larger than it is today.\n- Wealth redistribution policies, such as higher taxes on the ultra-wealthy, could limit the growth of the richest person's net worth.\n- It is also possible that the wealth of the richest person may not grow as rapidly as the overall economy due to various factors, such as market fluctuations, business risks, and changes in consumer preferences.\n\nOn the NO side:\n- The wealth of the richest person in the world has been growing at a faster rate than the overall economy, due to factors such as technological advancements, globalization, and financial markets.\n- The current richest person, Elon Musk, has a net worth of around $250 billion, which is already close to 1% of the current US GDP (around $21 trillion).\n- If the wealth of the richest person continues to grow at a faster rate than the US GDP, it is possible that their net worth could exceed 2% of the US GDP in 2033.\n\nConsidering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the richest person in the world in 2033 having a net worth less than 2% of the United States' GDP at the time is around 60%.\n\n[Answer] 0.6",
                "On the YES side, as of 2021, the richest person in the world, Elon Musk, has a net worth of around $200 billion. The US GDP in 2021 is approximately $22 trillion. This means Musk's net worth is around 0.9% of the US GDP. Assuming that the richest person's wealth grows at a similar rate to the US GDP, it is likely that the richest person in 2033 will have a net worth less than 2% of the US GDP at the time.\n\nOn the NO side, there is a possibility that the wealth of the richest person could grow at a much faster rate than the US GDP. This could be due to a series of successful investments, technological breakthroughs, or other factors that lead to a significant increase in wealth for that individual.\n\nTaking both sides into consideration, I estimate that the probability of the richest person in the world in 2033 having a net worth less than 2% of the United States' GDP at the time is relatively high.\n\n[Answer] 0.8",
                "For this question, we need to consider two factors: the net worth of the richest person in the world and the expected United States' GDP in 2033.\n\nOn the YES side, as of 2021, the richest person in the world is Elon Musk, with a net worth of around $250 billion. The United States' GDP in 2021 is approximately $21 trillion. Elon Musk's net worth is about 1.2% of the current United States' GDP. Assuming that the richest person's net worth grows at a similar pace as the United States' GDP, it is possible that the richest person in 2033 could have a net worth less than 2% of the United States' GDP at the time.\n\nOn the NO side, the net worth of the richest person in the world has been increasing at a faster pace than the United States' GDP growth. For instance, the net worth of Jeff Bezos, who was the richest person in the world in 2018, was about 1% of the United States' GDP. In just three years, Elon Musk's net worth has grown to 1.2% of the United States' GDP. If this trend continues, the richest person in 2033 might have a net worth greater than 2% of the United States' GDP at the time.\n\nConsidering both sides, I estimate that the probability of the richest person in the world in 2033 having a net worth less than 2% of the United States' GDP at the time is around 60%.\n\n[Answer] 0.6",
                "To answer this question, we need to consider the potential growth of the richest person's net worth and the growth of the United States' GDP.\n\nOn the YES side:\n- The richest person's net worth may not grow as rapidly as the US GDP, especially if there are wealth redistribution policies, market fluctuations, or other factors that limit the growth of individual wealth.\n- The US GDP is expected to grow over the next decade, potentially outpacing the growth of individual wealth.\n\nOn the NO side:\n- The richest person's net worth may grow faster than the US GDP, especially if they continue to invest in high-growth industries or if their wealth is concentrated in assets that appreciate rapidly.\n- The US GDP growth may slow down due to various factors such as economic downturns, political events, or other unforeseen circumstances.\n\nLet's look at some numbers for context:\n- As of 2021, the richest person in the world is Elon Musk, with a net worth of approximately $200 billion.\n- The US GDP in 2021 is around $21 trillion.\n\nCurrently, the richest person's net worth is less than 1% of the US GDP. Assuming a modest GDP growth rate of 2% per year, the US GDP in 2033 would be around $30 trillion. To reach 2% of the US GDP in 2033, the richest person's net worth would need to be around $600 billion.\n\nConsidering the historical trend of wealth concentration and the potential for rapid wealth growth in certain industries, I estimate that the probability of the richest person in the world in 2033 having a net worth less than 2% of the United States' GDP at the time is around 75%.\n\n[Answer] 0.75"

Vaccination rates: As more people get vaccinated, the overall number of cases is expected to decrease, making it less likely for summer peaks to exceed winter peaks.\n2. Seasonality: Respiratory viruses, including COVID-19, tend to spread more easily in colder months, contributing to higher case numbers during the winter.\n3. Implementation of preventive measures: Lessons learned from previous waves and the implementation of preventive measures can help control the spread of the virus during the summer months.\n\nConsidering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the peak 7-day average of COVID-19 cases or CLI in Virginia during a summer not exceeding the same peak during the preceding winter is relatively high.\n\nOn the NO side, there are factors that could lead to a summer peak exceeding the winter peak:\n\n1.

                "On the YES side, the widespread availability of COVID-19 vaccines and their effectiveness in reducing the severity of the disease could result in lower peak 7-day averages during the summer months compared to the preceding winter. Additionally, the seasonality of respiratory viruses, including coronaviruses, generally leads to lower transmission rates during warmer months. Moreover, the natural progression of the pandemic and increasing population immunity might contribute to a decline in case numbers over time. Thus, I estimate the probability of the peak 7-day average of COVID-19 cases or CLI in Virginia not exceeding the preceding winter peak during any summer before November 2026 to be moderately high.\n\nOn the NO side, the emergence of new COVID-19 variants with higher transmissibility or resistance to vaccines could lead to a resurgence of cases during summer months. Furthermore, vaccine hesitancy or disparities in vaccine distribution may hinder the achievement of sufficient population immunity. Lastly, changes in social behavior, relaxation of restrictions, or increases in travel during summer months could contribute to higher case numbers. Therefore, I estimate the probability of the peak 7-day average of COVID-19 cases or CLI in Virginia not exceeding the preceding winter peak during any summer before November 2026 to be moderately low.\n\nTaking both sides into account, I estimate the probability to be:\n\n[Answer] 0.65",

                "If Puerto Rico becomes a US state by 2035, several factors will play a role in determining the political affiliation of their first two elected Senators.\n\nOn the YES side, Puerto Rico's political landscape has historically leaned Democratic. In the 2020 election, Joe Biden won 58.4% of the vote in Puerto Rico. Furthermore, the current Resident Commissioner, Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n, is affiliated with the Republican Party. If Puerto Rico becomes a state by 2035, the political landscape may have evolved, and there could be a chance that at least one of the two elected Senators is not a Democrat.\n\nOn the NO side, the Democratic Party has strong support among Puerto Ricans, both on the island and in the mainland United States. If Puerto Rico becomes a state, it is likely that the Democratic Party will continue to maintain a strong presence in the territory, potentially leading to both Senators being Democrats.\n\nTaking both views into account, I estimate the probability of the first two elected Senators not both being Democrats to be around 40%.\n\n[Answer] 0.4",
                "On the YES side, Puerto Rico has historically leaned Democratic in its politics. According to a 2012 report by the Puerto Rico State Elections Commission, 80% of Puerto Ricans identified as Democrats. In recent non-binding referendums, the majority of Puerto Ricans have shown support for statehood, and Democrats have been more supportive of Puerto Rico's statehood than Republicans. Therefore, if Puerto Rico becomes a state, it is likely that the majority of voters would elect Democratic senators.\n\nOn the NO side, it is important to consider that local politics in Puerto Rico do not always align with the traditional Democrat-Republican divide. The island has its own political parties, such as the New Progressive Party (PNP) and the Popular Democratic Party (PPD), which focus on the issue of statehood and territorial status. Therefore, it is possible that some voters may not strictly adhere to the Democratic Party line when electing senators. Additionally, political landscapes can change significantly over time, and it is difficult to predict the exact preferences of Puerto Rican voters in 2035.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I estimate that the probability of Puerto Rico's first two elected senators not both being Democrats, if it becomes a U.S. state by 2035, is around 30%.\n\n[Answer] 0.3",

In the 2020 non-binding statehood referendum, 52.52% of Puerto Ricans voted in favor of statehood, and the majority of these voters tend to lean Democratic. Additionally, the current Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico, Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n, is a member of the Republican Party, indicating that there is some Republican support on the island. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of Puerto Rico's first two elected Senators not both being Democrats is moderate.\n\nOn the NO side, if Puerto Rico becomes a state, the Democratic Party may invest significant resources in the island to ensure that both of its Senators are Democrats. Additionally, Puerto Rico's political landscape could change by 2035, making it difficult to predict which party will have the upper hand. Given these uncertainties, I estimate that the probability of Puerto Rico's first two elected Senators not both being Democrats is lower.\n\nTaking both sides into account, I would estimate the probability of Puerto Rico's first two elected Senators not both being Democrats, if it becomes a US state by 2035, to be around 60%.\n\n[Answer] 0.6",

The island's political parties do not align perfectly with the US parties, but the Popular Democratic Party (PDP) and the New Progressive Party (NPP) are the major parties. The PDP is generally more aligned with the US Democratic Party, while the NPP is somewhat more aligned with the US Republican Party. Therefore, it is likely that if Puerto Rico becomes a state, its first Senators could be Democrats.\n\nOn the NO side, the political landscape can change over time, and it is possible that by 2035, Puerto Rico's political alignment might shift. Also, the NPP has won gubernatorial elections in the past, which indicates that Puerto Rican voters may not necessarily vote exclusively for Democratic candidates. Moreover, the process of Puerto Rico becoming a state might involve negotiations and compromises that could influence the political leanings of the island's electorate.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I estimate that the probability of Puerto Rico's first two elected Senators not both being Democrats is around 40%.\n\n[Answer] 0.4",
                "On the YES side, Puerto Rico's politics is dominated by two main parties: the pro-statehood New Progressive Party (PNP) and the pro-commonwealth Popular Democratic Party (PPD). Both parties have members that are affiliated with the Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. Congress. However, the PNP has historically been more aligned with the Republican Party, while the PPD has been more aligned with the Democratic Party. If Puerto Rico becomes a state, it is possible that one or both of the Senators could be affiliated with the Republican Party, especially if the PNP continues to dominate local politics. Hence, I estimate the probability of not both Senators being Democrats to be around 60%.\n\nOn the NO side, Puerto Rico has a strong Democratic-leaning voter base due to its residents' support for social programs and progressive policies. If Puerto Rico becomes a state, the Democratic Party could make significant efforts to consolidate its support on the island. Furthermore, the national trend of increasing Democratic support in urban areas and among Hispanic voters could also play a role in Puerto Rico's Senate elections. Therefore, I estimate the probability of both Senators being Democrats to be around 40%.\n\nTaking both sides into account, the probability of Puerto Rico's first 2 elected Senators not both being Democrats if it becomes a US state by 2035 is:\n\n[Answer] 0.6",

In the 2020 general elections, the pro-statehood New Progressive Party (PNP) won the governorship, but its candidate also identified as a Democrat. Additionally, the current non-voting delegate in the U.S. House of Representatives from Puerto Rico is a Democrat. Given these factors, it seems likely that if Puerto Rico were to become a state, its first two senators could both be Democrats. I estimate the probability of both senators being Democrats to be around 70%.\n\nOn the NO side, political affiliations and preferences can change over time, and new parties or movements can emerge. Additionally, the process of becoming a state could shift the political landscape in Puerto Rico, making it more competitive for Republicans or other parties.

                "Lepton universality is a principle in the Standard Model of particle physics that states that all leptons (electron, muon, and tau) should interact with gauge bosons (W, Z, and photon) in the same way, apart from differences due to their masses.\n\nOn the YES side, lepton universality has been well-established through numerous experimental tests over the past decades, and it is a fundamental aspect of the Standard Model. If it were to be falsified, it would require significant revisions to our understanding of particle physics. Given the current experimental evidence, I estimate that the probability of lepton universality not being falsified before 2026 is high.\n\nOn the NO side, there have been some recent experimental results from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and other experiments that hint at potential deviations from lepton universality. These results have not yet reached the level of statistical significance required to claim a discovery (5-sigma), but they have generated interest in the possibility of new physics beyond the Standard Model. If further experimental data confirms these deviations, lepton universality could be falsified.

If a situation arises in which an offensive nuclear detonation occurs anywhere, it is possible that North Korea could be involved, given its history and current capabilities. In such a case, the likelihood of at least one fatality resulting from the detonation is high, considering the destructive nature of nuclear weapons. Thus, I would estimate the probability of at least one fatality from an offensive nuclear detonation in North Korea by 2050, if there's an offensive detonation anywhere, to be moderately high.\n\nOn the NO side, the international community has been working to prevent nuclear proliferation and the use of nuclear weapons. Diplomatic efforts, such as negotiations and sanctions, may continue to deter North Korea from using nuclear weapons offensively. Additionally, the possibility of a regime change or shifts in global politics could reduce the likelihood of North Korea engaging in an offensive nuclear detonation. With these factors in mind, I would estimate the probability of at least one fatality from an offensive nuclear detonation in North Korea by 2050, if there's an offensive detonation anywhere, to be moderately low.\n\nTaking both perspectives into account, I would estimate the probability to be around:\n\n[Answer] 0.4"

Additionally, the concept of mutually assured destruction has acted as a deterrent against the use of nuclear weapons. International diplomatic efforts and arms control treaties, like the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), have contributed to reducing the risk of nuclear conflict.

The global trend towards nuclear disarmament: Countries have been reducing their nuclear arsenals since the end of the Cold War. The number of nuclear weapons in the world has decreased from around 70,000 in the 1980s to around 13,000 in 2020.\n\n2. The rise of precision-guided weapons: Modern militaries are increasingly using precision-guided weapons, which allow for more targeted strikes with less collateral damage. This may reduce the need for high-yield nuclear weapons in offensive operations.\n\n3. The deterrent effect of nuclear weapons: The destructive power of nuclear weapons acts as a deterrent against their use. The fear of retaliation, known as mutually assured destruction (MAD), has helped prevent the use of nuclear weapons since the end of World War II.\n\n4.

                "On the YES side, Apple has shown interest in the health and fitness industry with products like Apple Watch and Fitness+ subscription service. Acquiring Peloton, a leading fitness equipment and streaming service provider, could potentially strengthen Apple's position in this market. Considering Apple's history of acquisitions to enhance its product offerings, there is a possibility that Apple might consider acquiring Peloton.

Additionally, Apple has been developing its own fitness services, which could potentially compete with Peloton's offerings. Moreover, the timeframe of 2050 is quite long, and many factors, such as market changes, competition, and company strategies, could significantly influence the likelihood of this acquisition.

Taking these factors into account, I estimate that the probability of Cummings not returning to a position of direct political power is quite high.\n\nOn the NO side, Cummings has been influential in British politics, notably as the chief strategist of the Vote Leave campaign during the Brexit referendum. His expertise in campaigns and strategy could make him a valuable asset in future political endeavors. Moreover, political landscapes can change dramatically over time, and it is possible that Cummings could find an opportunity to return to a position of direct political power. Considering these factors, I estimate there is a moderate probability of Cummings returning to political power before 2050.\n\nTaking both views into account, I estimate the probability of Dominic Cummings not returning to a position of direct political power in the UK before 2050 to be around 70%.\n\n[Answer] 0.7"

                "On the YES side, there is increasing awareness and concern about the ethical treatment of animals, environmental impacts, and public health issues related to commercial animal farming. This could potentially lead to policy changes in the future. The rise of plant-based and lab-grown meat alternatives might also contribute to a decline in demand for commercial animal farming. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of commercial animal farming being prohibited in the US by 2041 is somewhat possible.\n\nOn the NO side, commercial animal farming is a significant part of the US economy and deeply ingrained in its culture. Additionally, the meat industry has strong lobbying power, which might make it difficult to pass legislation prohibiting commercial animal farming. Furthermore, it is unclear whether alternative protein sources can fully replace the demand for animal farming products by 2041. Given these factors, I estimate that the probability of commercial animal farming being prohibited in the US by 2041 is quite low.\n\nTaking both sides into consideration, I estimate the probability of commercial animal farming being prohibited in the US by 2041 to be around 20%.\n\n[Answer] 0.2",

                "On the YES side, the historical trend of globalization and political integration has led to the creation of larger political entities like the European Union, which could suggest that a single government might govern 80% of Earth's population and economy by 2100.\nHowever, the world's population is diverse, and there are significant cultural, political, and economic differences among countries.\nThe probability of a single government governing 80% of the world's population and economy by 2100, considering these factors, seems low.\n\nOn the NO side, the current global political landscape is marked by the existence of multiple powerful nations with different political systems and ideologies.\nMoreover, there is a rise in nationalism and regionalism in many parts of the world, leading to the fragmentation of political entities rather than their unification.\nTaking into account the historical precedent and current global trends, the probability of a single government not governing 80% of Earth's population and economy by 2100 seems high.\n\nHence, I estimate that the probability of one government not governing 80% of Earth's population and economy by 2100 is around 95%.\n\n[Answer] 0.95",
                "On the YES side, the world has historically been moving towards globalization and interconnectedness.\nHowever, the sheer diversity of political systems, cultures, and economies around the world makes it challenging for a single government to govern 80% of Earth's population and economy.\nThe probability of this happening by 2100 seems low.\n\nOn the NO side, the world has seen an increase in regionalism and nationalism in recent years.\nMoreover, the rise of emerging economies and the multipolar world order reduces the likelihood of a single government dominating the global population and economy.\nAdditionally, the decentralization of power through technology and the internet might make it harder for a single government to have control over such a large portion of the global population and economy.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I estimate that the probability of one government governing 80% of Earth's population and economy by 2100 is quite low.\n\n[Answer] 0.1",

The idea of a single government governing 80% of the Earth's population and economy would require a significant shift in political power and global cooperation. Additionally, history has shown that large empires tend to collapse due to internal and external pressures. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of this scenario not happening is high.\n\nOn the NO side (one government governs 80% of Earth's population and economy by 2100), a significant event, such as a global crisis or technological advancement, could lead to the formation of a global government.

Based on this historical evidence, the probability of mainstream news media not reporting alien technology visiting our solar system before 2030 is quite high.\n\nOn the NO side, the recent increase in interest and funding for space exploration and research, such as the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope, could potentially lead to new discoveries. Additionally, the recent declassification of UFO reports by the US government has generated more public interest in the possibility of extraterrestrial life.\n\nTaking both sides into account, I estimate that the probability of mainstream news media not reporting that alien technology has visited our solar system before 2030 is around 95%.\n\n[Answer] 0.95",

                "On the YES side, tensions between China and Taiwan have been increasing in recent years. China has been increasing its military presence near Taiwan and conducting military exercises that simulate an invasion. China considers Taiwan to be a part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve reunification. Furthermore, Chinese President Xi Jinping has stated that the issue of Taiwan's reunification cannot be passed on from generation to generation. This may suggest a sense of urgency in resolving the issue.\n\nConsidering these factors, I estimate the probability of a full-scale invasion of Taiwan by China before 2030 to be moderately high.\n\nOn the NO side, a full-scale invasion of Taiwan would have significant geopolitical consequences. The United States and other countries have committed to supporting Taiwan's defense, and an invasion could lead to a large-scale conflict in the region. Additionally, China may face economic sanctions and international isolation if it were to invade Taiwan. These factors may deter China from launching a full-scale invasion.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I estimate the probability of a full-scale invasion of Taiwan by China before 2030 to be moderately low.\n\nBalancing both sides, I would estimate the probability of a full-scale invasion of Taiwan by China before 2030 to be around 40%.\n\n[Answer] 0.4",

China has long considered Taiwan a part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to bring it under its control. Additionally, China's military capabilities have grown significantly, making a full-scale invasion more feasible than in the past. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of China launching a full-scale invasion of Taiwan before 2030 is non-negligible.\n\nOn the NO side, a full-scale invasion of Taiwan would carry significant risks for China, including potential economic sanctions, international condemnation, and possible military conflict with the United States and its allies. Furthermore, China may prefer to pursue a strategy of gradually increasing pressure on Taiwan, seeking to eventually achieve reunification through non-military means. Additionally, the timeline of 2030 might be too short for China to decide on such a drastic measure. Hence, I estimate that the probability of China not launching a full-scale invasion of Taiwan before 2030 is considerably higher.\n\nTaking both sides into account, I would estimate the probability of China launching a full-scale invasion of Taiwan before 2030 to be around 15%.\n\n[Answer] 0.15",

The Chinese military has been modernizing and expanding its capabilities, which could potentially be used in an invasion of Taiwan. Furthermore, China's President Xi Jinping has been assertive in pursuing territorial claims in the region, which may suggest a willingness to take military action. Based on these factors, I estimate the probability of a full-scale invasion of Taiwan before 2030 to be moderately high.\n\nOn the NO side, a full-scale invasion of Taiwan would carry significant risks and costs for China. It would likely provoke a strong international response, including potential military intervention from the United States and its allies. Additionally, a war with Taiwan could have negative consequences for China's economy and global standing.

Based on these factors, I estimate that the probability of the two countries not being recognized as a unified sovereign state by 2045 is relatively high.\n\nOn the NO side, there have been instances of dialogue and cooperation between the two Koreas in recent years. The 2018 inter-Korean summit and the Panmunjom Declaration showed some willingness from both sides to work towards peace and eventual reunification. Furthermore, global and regional powers, such as the US and China, could play a role in facilitating reunification if it aligns with their strategic interests. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the two countries being recognized as a unified sovereign state by 2045 is relatively low but still possible.\n\nTaking both sides into account, I estimate the probability of North Korea and South Korea not being recognized as a unified sovereign state by 2045 is around 80%.\n\n[Answer] 0.8",
                "On the YES side, the political and ideological differences between North and South Korea are significant, which complicates the unification process.\nNorth Korea is an isolated, authoritarian regime with nuclear capabilities, while South Korea is a democratic, technologically advanced nation.\nThe economic disparities between the two countries would also make unification a challenging and expensive process.\nMoreover, the presence of international players, such as the US and China, might deter unification to maintain the regional balance of power.\nConsidering these factors, I estimate that the probability of North Korea and South Korea not being recognized as a unified sovereign state by 2045 is relatively high.\n\nOn the NO side, there have been instances of dialogue and cooperation between the two countries in recent years.\nUnification is still a long-term goal for both nations, and unexpected geopolitical changes could make it more likely.\nHowever, given the current situation and historical context, the probability of unification happening by 2045 seems relatively low.\n\nTaking both sides into account, I estimate that the probability of North Korea and South Korea not being recognized as a unified sovereign state by 2045 is around 85%.\n\n[Answer] 0.85"

Additionally, advances in lab-grown meat technology could potentially reduce the demand for traditional animal farming. Considering these factors, there is a possibility that commercial farming of cows, pigs, and chickens for meat could be prohibited in the US by 2041. However, this scenario would require significant changes in regulations, public opinion, and market forces.\n\nOn the NO side, the meat industry is deeply ingrained in the US economy and culture, and it has a significant lobbying presence in the government. Banning commercial farming of cows, pigs, and chickens for meat would face strong opposition from the industry and many consumers. Additionally, alternative protein sources and lab-grown meat would need to become more accessible and affordable to replace traditional meat farming. Taking these factors into account, it seems less likely that commercial farming of these animals for meat will be prohibited by 2041.\n\nGiven the current state of the industry, public opinion, and technological advancements, I estimate the probability of commercial farming of cows, pigs, and chickens for meat being prohibited in the US by 2041 to be relatively low.\n\n[Answer] 0.1",

                "On the YES side, there has been increasing scrutiny and criticism of donor-advised funds (DAFs) in recent years. Critics argue that these funds allow wealthy individuals to take immediate tax deductions without necessarily distributing the funds to charitable organizations in a timely manner. This has led to a growing call for reforms, including disbursement requirements or payout deadlines.\n\nIn June 2021, a bipartisan bill called the \"Accelerating Charitable Efforts (ACE) Act\" was introduced in the U.S. Senate. The bill proposes various reforms, including a 15-year payout deadline for DAFs. If this bill, or a similar one, gains traction in Congress, it could lead to the passage of a federal law imposing disbursement requirements on DAF accounts. Considering the bipartisan support for the ACE Act, I estimate the probability of a federal law passing before 2031 to be somewhat likely.\n\nOn the NO side, the philanthropic sector and DAF sponsors have been resistant to the idea of imposing disbursement requirements. They argue that such requirements could reduce flexibility and discourage charitable giving. Additionally, the political climate in the U.S. is highly polarized, and it is uncertain whether lawmakers will prioritize this issue in the coming years.\n\nTaking both sides into account, I estimate that the probability of a federal law imposing disbursement requirements on donor-advised fund accounts passing in the United States before 2031 is around 40%.\n\n[Answer] 0.4",

Several proposals have been introduced to Congress to address these concerns, such as the Accelerating Charitable Efforts (ACE) Act. This suggests that there is some momentum for reform in this area. Considering this, I estimate the probability of a federal law passing before 2031 is moderately high.\n\nOn the NO side, the philanthropic sector, including some large DAF providers, has been pushing back against these proposals, arguing that they would harm charitable giving. Additionally, the political landscape in the United States is often unpredictable, and it is unclear whether this issue will remain a priority for lawmakers over the next decade. Furthermore, the divided nature of Congress could make it difficult for any legislation to pass.

The Initiative to Accelerate Charitable Giving (IACG) has proposed reforms to incentivize more timely disbursements from DAFs. Some lawmakers, like Senators Angus King and Chuck Grassley, have expressed interest in these proposals.\n\nMoreover, there is a growing concern about wealth inequality and philanthropy in the United States. This could lead to increased pressure for regulation of DAFs, which have been criticized for allowing donors to receive immediate tax benefits without ensuring that the funds are disbursed to charities in a timely manner.\n\nConsidering these factors, I estimate that there is a moderate probability of a federal law imposing disbursement requirements on DAFs passing before 2031.\n\nOn the NO side, DAFs have powerful supporters, including financial institutions and philanthropic organizations that benefit from their current structure. These supporters may lobby against any significant changes to DAF regulations.\n\nAdditionally, the United States has a highly polarized political environment, and it may be difficult for a bipartisan consensus to emerge on this issue.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I estimate that there is a significant probability that a federal law imposing disbursement requirements on DAFs will not pass before 2031.\n\n[Answer] 0.4",

However, there are also fiscally conservative Democrats who may push for spending cuts in certain areas to balance the budget or to fund other initiatives. Additionally, external events and economic conditions could force a Democratic President to sign a spending cut package. Given these factors, I estimate the probability of a $500 billion spending cut being signed into law by a Democratic President before 2029 to be moderate.\n\nOn the NO side, the Democratic Party has been more focused on expanding social programs, investing in infrastructure, and addressing climate change, which typically require increased spending. Furthermore, the current political climate seems to lean towards increased government spending to address economic inequality and other challenges.

                "On the YES side, Russia is the largest country in the world, covering more than 17 million square kilometers. A 20% decrease in territory would require a significant geopolitical event or a massive loss of land due to climate change. Geopolitical events of this magnitude are relatively rare, and the current global political climate does not seem to indicate a high likelihood of such an event occurring. Also, while climate change is causing issues such as melting permafrost, it is unlikely to cause a 20% loss of territory within the next seven years. Therefore, I estimate the probability of Russia's total territory not decreasing by at least 20% before 2028 to be quite high.\n\nOn the NO side, unforeseen geopolitical events, conflicts, or natural disasters could potentially lead to a significant loss of territory.

                "On the YES side, the deployment of artificial intelligence systems has the potential to cause global catastrophes, especially if they are not designed carefully or if they are used inappropriately. This could happen through unintended consequences, autonomous weapons, or malicious uses of AI. Some experts have expressed concerns about the risks associated with the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and the possibility of an intelligence explosion. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of a global catastrophe due to AI before 2100 is non-negligible.\n\nOn the NO side, there are several other potential causes of global catastrophes that could occur before 2100. These include climate change, nuclear war, pandemics, asteroid impacts, and large-scale ecological collapse. Many experts believe that the risks associated with these other factors are higher than those associated with AI. Furthermore, AI could also be used to help mitigate some of these risks, such as improving climate modeling or assisting in disaster response. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of a global catastrophe not being principally due to AI before 2100 is higher than the probability of it being due to AI.\n\nTaking both views into account, I estimate that the probability of a global catastrophe happening before 2100 and not being principally due to the deployment of some artificial intelligence system(s) is around 70%.\n\n[Answer] 0.7",
                "On the YES side, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to cause significant harm if misused, poorly designed, or if it falls into the wrong hands. The development of autonomous weapons and the possibility of an AI arms race could lead to catastrophic consequences. Additionally, the risk of unintended consequences from AI systems, such as the alignment problem, could also pose a danger. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of a global catastrophe being principally due to the deployment of some AI system(s) is moderate.\n\nOn the NO side, there are various other potential causes of global catastrophes, including climate change, nuclear war, pandemics, and asteroid impacts. The likelihood of a global catastrophe happening before 2100 due to one of these factors is also significant. Furthermore, the development of AI might also contribute to mitigating some of these risks, such as through improved climate modeling or medical research. Hence, I estimate that the probability of a global catastrophe not being principally due to the deployment of some AI system(s) is high.\n\nTaking both sides into account, I would estimate that the probability of a global catastrophe happening before 2100 not being principally due to the deployment of some AI system(s) is around 75%.\n\n[Answer] 0.75",

One example is the Free State Project, which aimed to move 20,000 libertarians to New Hampshire to create a libertarian stronghold. However, this project has not yet achieved its goal, even after two decades.\n\nOn the NO side, organizing and executing a coordinated effort to move 10,000+ residents to a single state is a complex task. It requires significant financial resources, logistical planning, and convincing individuals to uproot their lives for a political cause.

However, these efforts have had limited success so far.\nMoreover, coordinating the intentional movement of 10,000+ residents to a single state within a short time frame is logistically challenging and requires significant resources.\nFurthermore, people's decisions to move are often influenced by various personal factors, such as job opportunities, family ties, and quality of life, which can make it difficult for a coordinated effort to achieve the desired outcome.\nTherefore, I estimate that the probability of a coordinated effort at foot voting not intentionally moving 10,000+ residents to a single American state by 2030 is high.\n\nOn the NO side, social media and modern communication tools have made it easier to organize and mobilize large groups of people.\nAdditionally, political polarization in the United States might encourage more people to participate in such coordinated efforts in the future.\nHowever, considering the historical success of similar efforts and the challenges involved, I estimate that the probability of a coordinated effort at foot voting intentionally moving 10,000+ residents to a single American state by 2030 is relatively low.\n\nHence, I estimate that the probability of a coordinated effort at foot voting not intentionally moving 10,000+ residents to a single American state by 2030 is around 85%.\n\n[Answer] 0.85",
